  GraphicsMagick makes use of third-party "delegate" libraries to
  support certain optional features. These libraries bear their own
  copyrights and licenses, which may be more or less restrictive than the
  GraphicsMagick license. For convenience, when GraphicsMagick is
  bundled with (or compiled with) "delegate" libraries, a copy of the
  licenses for these libraries is provided in a "licenses" directory.
