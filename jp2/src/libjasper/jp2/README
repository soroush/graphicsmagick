This directory contains the code for the support of the JPEG-2000
JP2 file format.

NOTE: THE JP2 SUPPORT IN JASPER IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES
ONLY AND IS NOT MEANT TO REPRESENT A COMPLETE AND FULLY CONFORMING JP2
IMPLEMENTATION.

The support for the JPEG-2000 JP2 file format is incomplete and not fully
compliant with the specification given in Annex I of ISO/IEC 15444-1:2001.
More specifically, JasPer does not provide a fully conforming JP2 decoder.
Several features required of a conforming JP2 file reader are missing
from the JasPer software.  These missing features include support for
palettized color, component mapping, and restricted ICC profiles.
