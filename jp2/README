JasPer Readme
*************

This is the source code distribution for JasPer.  JasPer is a collection
of software (i.e., a library and application programs) for the coding
and manipulation of images.  This software can handle image data in a
variety of formats.  One such format supported by JasPer is the JPEG-2000
code stream format defined in ISO/IEC 15444-1:2000.

The JasPer software only includes a partial implementation of the
JPEG-2000 JP2 file format specified in ISO/IEC 15444-1:2000.  More
specifically, the JasPer software does not provide a fully conforming JP2
file reader as defined in ISO/IEC 15444-1:2000.  Several features required
of a conforming JP2 file reader are missing from the JasPer software.
These missing features include support for palettized color, component
mapping, and restricted ICC profiles.

When decoding JPEG-2000 code streams, the JasPer software allows the
user to assume that the decoded components are in a RGB color space
or grayscale.  In general, additional information is required in order
to determine the true nature of the component data.  Support for such
information is provided by the JP2 file format but is not processed by
the JasPer software.

The complete licensing terms for the JasPer software can be found in
the file named "LICENSE" in the top level directory of this software
distribution.  Any use of this software contrary to the terms of the
license is strictly prohibited.  The changes made to the software
since the last release are described in the file "NEWS".  Detailed
documentation on the JasPer software can be found in the JasPer Software
Reference Manual.  This manual is located in the "doc" directory, and
includes useful information such as: 1) how to build, install, and use
the software, 2) how to report bugs, and 3) where to find additional
information about the software.

Enjoy! :)
