Hi, Folks.

I am pleased to announce the availability of JasPer version 1.600.0.
Numerous changes have been made to the software since the last public release.
A few of the highlights are listed below.  This list is in no particular
order, and is not intended to be exhaustive.

1) The support for the JP2 format has been improved.  Previously, the
information contained in the types of boxes associated with component
definitions/mappings was mostly ignored (i.e., CDEF, CMAP, PCLR, COLR).
Now, these boxes are handled more intelligently.  As a result, palettized
images are processed correctly.  Also, images with different color spaces
are better handled.

2) A new application program, called "jiv", has been added to the software
distribution.  This program is a simple image viewer.  The code is based
on the OpenGL and GLUT libraries, and is known to compile and run under
Windows and various flavors of UNIX, provided that the necessary libraries
are available.  (Incidentally, partial support for color images is included
in the jiv application program, but is *disabled* by default.)

3) The support for the PNM family of formats has been improved (and
should now be truly complete).  The code has been modified to correctly
handle image data in binary form with more than 8 bits/sample.  Also,
the PBM case is handled now.

4) Numerous other minor bugs have been fixed.

The new JasPer release is available from the JasPer Project Home Page
(i.e., http://www.ece.uvic.ca/~mdadams/jasper) and the JPEG web site
(i.e., http://www.jpeg.org/software).

Lastly, I would like to thank the following individuals for reporting
