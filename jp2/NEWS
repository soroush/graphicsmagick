Hi, Folks.

I am pleased to announce the availability of the next release of JasPer,
version 1.500.4.  This release does not contain any significant code
changes.  It does, however, contain updated documentation, including
a detailed technical tutorial on the JPEG-2000 standard.

The new JasPer release is available via the JasPer Project Home Page
(i.e., http://www.ece.ubc.ca/~mdadams/jasper).
The software should also be available from the JPEG web site some time
in the near future (i.e., http://www.jpeg.org/software).

Regards,
Michael
