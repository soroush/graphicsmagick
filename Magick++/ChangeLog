1999-04-25  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* lib/MagickImage.cpp (montageGeometry): Return Magick::Geometry
 	rather than std::string.

1999-04-19  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* lib/MagickColor.cpp (alpha): Added support for setting alpha via
 	scaled-double to the Color class.  The new method name is 'alpha'.

1999-04-13  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* lib/MagickColor.cpp: Added support for setting an alpha value
 	(unscaled Quantum only) for use on DirectColor images that have
 	matte enabled.  This requires ImageMagick 4.2.2 dated April 13,
 	1999 or later to compile since Cristy added a special flag to
 	allow testing to see if the user has specified an opacity value:
 	"I added XColorFlags to magick/classify.h.  If DoMatte is set in
 	color->flags then the opacity value is valid in color->pixel."

1999-04-11  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* demo/flip.cpp (main): New file.  Demonstrates use of flipImage
 	function object as well as morphImages algorithm.

1999-04-10  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* tests/color.cpp : New file to support testing the Magick::Color
 	classes.

	* lib/MagickOptions.cpp: The ImageInfo filter member is now
 	ignored by ImageMagick (as of ImageMagick 4.2.2 April 10, 1998) so
 	support for setting it is removed. The Image filter member is
 	still updated. According to Cristy, this ImageMagick version
 	removes automatic sharpening of resized images.  The blur member
 	is added to the Image structure. A blur value < 1 causes the image
 	to be sharpened when resizing while a value > 1 leaves the image
 	blurry.  Magick++ does not yet support the blur member.
