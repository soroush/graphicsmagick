Many thanks to John Cristy <magick@wizards.dupont.com> for
developing the powerful ImageMagick package that Magick++ is based
on and for enhancing ImageMagick API features in order to allow a
cleaner implementation.

Also thanks to Bill Radcliffe <BillR@corbis.com> for his assistance
with getting Magick++ to compile under Visual C++, and for maintaining
the Windows build environment.
