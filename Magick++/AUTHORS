The principle author and maintainer of Magick++ is Bob Friesenhan
<bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>.

Many thanks to John Cristy <magick@wizards.dupont.com> for
developing the powerful ImageMagick package that Magick++ is based
on and for enhancing ImageMagick API features in order to allow a
cleaner implementation.
