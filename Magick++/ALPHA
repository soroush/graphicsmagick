This release of Magick++ is an Alpha release. As such, there may be bugs or
inconsistencies which effect proper operation of the library. The goal of
Alpha releases is to find these bugs and inconsistencies. Alpha releases
should only be used by those who are willing to assist with finding defects
and providing solutions to those defects if possible.

Since this is an Alpha release, feel free to suggest changes to class names
or organization. I am very interested in ensuring that Magick++ is both easy
to use and powerful. Until basic issues have been worked out, I am not
interested in minor efficiency issues. This is why I have not bothered to
make any of the methods inline yet.

Please report any problems to Bob Friesenhahn <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>.

The Alpha-test team is as follows:

Bill Radcliffe <BillR@corbis.com>
Jim Ellsworth <jellsworth@lifetouch.com>
Michael L. Welles <mike@queso.onshore.com>
Chris Friesen <cfriesen@home.com>
John Vechey <John.Vechey@won.net>
