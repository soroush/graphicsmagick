Items large and small which remain to be done before Magick++ 1.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Support manipulating IPTC profiles directly. Bill Radcliffe
  <BillR@corbis.com> has agreed to write a container class to support
  this.

* Integrate with GdkMagick.

* Port to Sun Workshop 5.0 under Solaris (no access to compiler yet
  but hope so eventually ...)

* Support building working DLL under Win32.

* Documentation based on Framemaker sources which produce Postscript,
  PDF, and HTML outputs.  Status: documentation for Magick++ is
  included in the ImageMagick documentation which is distributed
  as a PDF file.  HTML generation not yet ready for use.

Items which will require the aid of volunteers.  Volunteers?
