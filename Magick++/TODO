Items large and small which remain to be worked on.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Add read/write methods to support user-supplied BLOBs which are
  supplied in raw form rather than via a Blob object.

* Use verbose flag on image to enable run-time tracing.

* Add microtimer support for image processing operations so that the
  processing time for the last operation is immediately available.

* Add support for OrderedDitherImage().

* Add support for specifying a CMS color profile (ImageInfo
  color_profile member).

* Look into adding/removing profiles via the ProfileImage function.

* Extend Image constructor to allow specifying DirectClass or
  PsuedoClass representation when creating a solid-color canvas.

* Add Image constructor that takes only a Geometry argument in order
  to support constructing an image with size, but without content.

* Fix floodFillTexture() so that it preserves the current texture.

* Fix documentation for drawing rounded rectangle.  Parameters
  represent corners, not center.

* Manage Options instance seperate from Image instance.  Possibly take
  this to the extreme by managing each contained structure
  independently.

* Support options stack similar to graphic-context.

* Provide interface to obtain font metrics for fonts handled by
  FreeType.  Would use the GetFontMetrics() API.

* Add support for new drawing primitives (some are not yet implemented):
  - clip-path %s  (%s is the name of the clip path
  - pop clip-path
  - push clip-path-%s  (%s is the name of the clip path)
  - viewbox (e.g. "viewbox 0 0 640 480")

* Support manipulating IPTC profiles directly. Bill Radcliffe
  <BillR@corbis.com> has agreed to write a container class to support
  this.

Items which will require the aid of volunteers.  Volunteers?
