Items large and small which remain to be worked on.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fix documentation for drawing rounded rectangle.  Parameters
  represent corners, not center.

* Manage Options instance seperate from Image instance.

* Support options stack similar to graphic-context.

* Add suppport for new drawing primitives:
  - clip-path %s  (%s is the name of the clip path
  - pop clip-path
  - push clip-path-%s  (%s is the name of the clip path)
  - viewbox (e.g. "viewbox 0 0 640 480")

* Support manipulating IPTC profiles directly. Bill Radcliffe
  <BillR@corbis.com> has agreed to write a container class to support
  this.
