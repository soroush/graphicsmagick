Items large and small which remain to be done before Magick++ 1.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Support an efficient yet simple way to manipulate image pixels and
  colormap (if pseudocolor) via an array style mechanism. Probably
  support image as a two-dimensional array of a derived class of
  Magick::Color. This is a complex problem which will take time to
  resolve since ImageMagick images are of six distinct varieties not
  including the many colorspaces the pixels can be represented in.

* Support manipulating IPTC profiles directly. Bill Radcliffe
  <BillR@corbis.com> has agreed to write a container class to support
  this.

* Support reading an image from a BLOB in memory for at least one
  format. Bill Radcliffe <BillR@corbis.com> has done work in this area.

* Port to CodeWarrior under NT

* Port to Sun Workshop 5.0 under Solaris


Items which will require the aid of volunteers
--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Port to Borland C++ Builder 4.0

* Port to KAI C++ (multi-platform) compiler

* Port to HP-UX aCC

* Port to SGI C++ compiler

* Provide integration with Blitz++ (http://monet.uwaterloo.ca/blitz/).
  Not sure what it would do other than aid with manipulating pixels.
