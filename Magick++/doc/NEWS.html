&nbsp;
<br>(0.9.3)
<ul>
<li>
Bugfix to the Pixels GetIndexes() method.</li>

<li>
Adapted to ImageMagick 5.2.1's revised matte channel interpretation.</li>
</ul>
(0.9.3)
<ul>
<li>
New class 'Pixels' to support low-level pixel access in image. New API
supports multiple pixel views into the same image. Number of available
pixel views limited to the number of image rows + 1.</li>

<li>
Dramatically improved performance for text annotation and drawing.</li>

<li>
Fix text annotation bug which did not allow spaces in annotation text.</li>

<li>
Added gaussianBlurImage() method.</li>

<li>
Fixed bug in floodFillTexture().</li>

<li>
Re-worked error reporting methodology to use re-entrant error reporting
rather than the previous method (based on call-backs) which required thread
specific data.</li>

<li>
Should be thread-safe under Win32 now.</li>
</ul>
(0.9.2)
<ul>
<li>
Should be thread-safe when used with POSIX threads (pthreads).</li>

<li>
Added methods getPixels, setPixels, syncPixels, readPixels, and writePixels,
in order to provide low-level access to Image pixels.</li>

<li>
Bugfix: size method was setting Options size, but not Image rows and columns.</li>
</ul>
(0.9.1)
<ul>
<li>
Added additional constructors, read, and write methods for BLOBs to make
BLOBs easier to use.</li>

<li>
Added the medianFilter() method to Image.</li>

<li>
Renamed transformColorSpace() to colorSpace() and added a colorSpace()
accessor method.</li>

<li>
Renamed psPageSize() to page(), which now properly returns the actual attribute
from the image, rather than the image options. This is important in order
to manipulate GIF animations.</li>

<li>
Bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
(0.9)
<ul>
<li>
Ported to ImageMagick 5.0.</li>

<li>
BLOB sizes are now specified using size_t type.</li>

<li>
Rotate() no longer accepts sharpen or crop options.</li>

<li>
Shear() No longer accepts a crop option.</li>

<li>
FontPointsize() now takes a double.</li>

<li>
The condense, uncondense, and condensed methods have been removed since
ImageMagick 5.0 no longer uses run-length encoding.</li>

<li>
The quantizeError method has been removed since it never worked.</li>

<li>
The cacheThreshold method is added to set the threshold of ImageMagick's
image cache.</li>
</ul>
(0.8.9)
<ul>
<li>
Blob reference counting was totally broken, leading to a memory leak if
it was used. Fixed by starting reference count from one rather than zero.</li>
</ul>
(0.8.8)
<ul>
<li>
Fixed a Image constructor bug when constructing from a Blob</li>
</ul>
(0.8.7)
<ul>
<li>
Bugfix: condensed() was returning wrong state.</li>
</ul>
(0.8.6)
<ul>
<li>
Color is now based on ImageMagick's RunlengthPacket structure (via a pointer)
so that it may eventually be used to represent an image pixel. This is
currently a work in progress.</li>
</ul>
(0.8.5)
<ul>
<li>
Headers are now installed under prefix/include/Magick++ on Unix systems
with the exception that Magick++.h is installed under prefix/include as
it was before. Programs which include Magick++.h (the documented approach)
should not be impacted.</li>

<li>
Image constructors to construct an image from a BLOB.</li>

<li>
Image read and write methods to decode and encode images stored in a BLOB.
This allows reading/writing image "files" from/to memory rather than a
traditional file.</li>
</ul>
(0.8.4)
<ul>
<li>
New mapImages algorithm maps a sequence of images to the colormap of a
provided image.</li>

<li>
New quantizeImages algorithm computes and applies a common colormap to
a sequence of images.</li>
</ul>
(0.8.3)
<ul>
<li>
Ported to ImageMagick 4.2.6.</li>

<li>
Blob supports default constructor.</li>

<li>
New Blob method updateNoCopy() to support efficient initialization by derived
class.</li>
</ul>
(0.8.2)
<ul>
<li>
Uses libtool 1.3 to build library under Unix and Cygwin (static lib only).</li>

<li>
Added Blob class to support supplying formatted binary data to methods.</li>

<li>
Added support for setting ICC and IPTC profiles from a binary BLOB.</li>

<li>
Added support for transformations of image data to/from alternate colorspace
(e.g. CYMK).</li>

<li>
Added support for 'pinging' an image (get image dimensions/size quickly).</li>

<li>
Added 'uncondense' method to de-compress in-memory image data.</li>

<li>
Added support for annotation using rotated text.</li>
</ul>
(0.8.1)
<ul>
<li>
Added support for setting alpha in Magick::Color</li>

<li>
Set/get color alpha in Magick::Image::pixelColor() for DirectClass images.</li>
</ul>
(0.8)
<ul>
<li>
Transitioned to Beta</li>

<li>
Improved Microsoft Visual C++ build environment.</li>
</ul>
(0.7.4)
<ul>
<li>
Added animateImages() and displayImages() to MagickSTL.h.</li>

<li>
Added function objects to support setting image attributes.</li>
</ul>
(0.7.3)
<ul>
<li>
Image::penTexture() now takes Image reference rather than Image pointer.
Set Image to invalid using isValid(false) to unset texture.</li>

<li>
Attribute methods that take Color, Geometry, Image, or string arguments
may now unset the attribute by setting the state of the object to invalid
using isValid(false), or the empty string (in the case of string). This
allows full control over ImageMagick attributes which are stored as C strings
which may be set to NULL.</li>

<li>
Updated for ImageMagick 4.2.1</li>
</ul>
(0.7.2)
<ul>
<li>
Added STL function object support for all Image manipulation methods to
support operating on all or part of the images stored in an STL container.</li>
</ul>
(0.7.1)
<ul>
<li>
Added Coordinate class and methods in Drawable to support x,y coordinates.</li>

<li>

<li>
Changed polygon methods in Drawable to use STL list argument.</li>

<li>
Added STL list based draw method to Image.</li>

<li>
Changed Exception heirarchy to support Warning and Error sub-classes. Most
exception class names have changed.</li>
</ul>
(0.7)
<ul>
<li>
Updated for ImageMagick 4.2.0</li>

<li>
Added support for flood-filling and drawing with texture.</li>

<li>
Montage supported.</li>

<li>
Oodles of bugs fixed.</li>

<li>

<li>
Some parameters re-ordered due to experience from writing demo programs.</li>

Initial support for integrating image-list oriented operations with STL
containers.</li>

Compiles and runs under Windows using Visual C++ 5.X or later.</li>

<li>
Users of Magick++ API are not exposed to ImageMagick headers.</li>

<li>
Magick++ API is namespaced under "Magick".</li>

<li>
"Magick" prefix removed from object names.</li>

<li>
User options are now completely contained within Image object. There is
no longer a MagickOptions parameter to some methods.</li>
</ul>
(0.1)
<ul>
<li>
All ImageMagick operations which operate on individual images are supported.</li>

<li>
Image objects have value semantics, avoid unnecessary image copies through
the use of reference counting, and may be compared via standard operators.</li>

<li>
Geometry, color, annotations, and user-options are supported by separate
classes.</li>

<li>
Errors are reported synchronously via C++ exceptions.</li>
</ul>
