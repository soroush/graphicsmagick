<p>This is Magick++, the object-oriented C++ API to the ImageMagick image-processing
library. Please report any problems to <a href="mailto:bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us">Bob
Friesenhahn &lt;bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us></a>.
<p>Magick++ supports an object model which is inspired by <a href="http://www.wizards.dupont.com/cristy/www/perl.html">PerlMagick</a>.
Magick++ should be a bit faster than PerlMagick since it is written in
a compiled language which is not parsed at run-time. This makes it suitable
for Web CGI programs. Images support implicit reference counting so that
copy constructors and assignment incur almost no cost. The cost of actually
copying an image (if necessary) is done just before modification and this
copy is managed automatically by Magick++. De-referenced copies are automatically
deleted. The image objects support value (rather than pointer)&nbsp; semantics
so it is trivial to support multiple generations of an image in memory
at one time.
<p>Magick++ provides integrated support for STL. This support allows Magick++
to be used with the <a href="http://www.sgi.com/Technology/STL/">Standard
Template Library</a> (STL) so that the powerful containers available (e.g.
vector and list)&nbsp; can be used to write programs similar to those possible
with PERL &amp; PerlMagick. STL-compatable template versions of ImageMagick's
list-style operations are provided so that operations may be performed
on multiple images stored in STL containers.
<p>Please be aware that until Magick++ reaches version 1.0, some minor
changes may be expected to implemented APIs based on operational experience.

Future Plans</h2></center>
At this early stage in development, there is no reason to artificially
constrain imagination or ambitions. Therefore, I have laid out a challenging
release plan for Magick++. What actually gets accomplished depends on the
level of support from users and developers. Volunteers are needed. In particular,
work on the CORBA IDL-base API may proceed in parallel with other development.
The following is the tentative development and release plan.
<p><b>1.0 </b>API for operating on individual images and STL containers
of images
<blockquote>This version supports all ImageMagick API operations which
operate on a single image as well as providing <a href="http://www.sgi.com/Technology/STL/">STL</a>
container support for operating on multiple images (on any STL compatable
container which supports a forward input iterator).</blockquote>

<blockquote>STL is used as the framework in which to store images. Template
functions (e.g. montage)&nbsp; are provided to build the image lists required
by ImageMagick and then invoke the list-oriented ImageMagick API. STL is
quite powerful yet easy to use. At this stage Magick++ has matched what
is currently available/possible using the PerlMagick API due to leveraging
the power of STL.</blockquote>
<b>2.0</b> <a href="http://www.omg.org/">CORBA</a> IDL based client API
with server implementation for executing image processing operations on
a remote (or local) computer.
<blockquote>This version provides a standard CORBA IDL-based API. A C++
wrapper API compatable with that developed for release 2.0 is available
for use by clients. Client wrappers may also be developed for other languages
(e.g. Java). A CORBA server is provided which is implemented in terms of
the Magick++ API in order to satisfy client requests (which may run a different
operating system than the server) . An implementation repository and object
activation is used to instantiate the server upon demand to ensure that
server machines are not unnecessarily burdended. The CORBA ORB employed
is expected to be <a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/TAO.html">TAO</a>
developed by <a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/">Doug Schmidt</a>
(and friends).</blockquote>
<b>3.0</b> Integration of IDL-based API with an existing open source work-queing
system in order to load-share image processing tasks and the image frame
and file level across a large number of machines.
<blockquote>This version is the culmination of the effort. By intelligently
spreading work over many machines, the performance of ImageMagick is magnified.
In order for this to be a success algorithms for efficient transfer of
image data must be developed. Algorithms that take into account processor
afinity and the CPU vs I/O tradeoff for the task to be performed must be
developed. At this point in time, the queuing system to be employed has
not been identified.</blockquote>
