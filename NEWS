Major changes associated with GraphicsMagick 1.0.0

  GraphicsMagick support services:
    * Master web site at "http://www.GraphicsMagick.org/".
    * Mailing lists, bug tracking, and forums available via
    "http://sourceforge.net/projects/graphicsmagick/".
    * CVSWeb via "http://cvs.graphicsmagick.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/".
    * CVS via cvs.graphicsmagick.org (find instructions at
    "http://www.graphicsmagick.org/www/cvs.html").
    * FTP via "ftp://ftp.graphicsmagick.org/pub/GraphicsMagick".

  Project maintenance improvements:
    * ChangeLog conforms to the GNU standard and all CVS commits include
    useful log messages.
    * CVS commit messages posted to graphicsmagick-commit mail list.
    * CVS commit messages contain CVSWeb URL references.

  Footprint changes from ImageMagick:
    * Library -lMagick renamed to -lGraphicsMagick.
    * Library -lMagick++ renamed to -lGraphicsMagick++.
    * Utilities consolidated into a single 'gm' utility (e.g. use 'gm
    convert').
    * Script Magick-config renamed to GraphicsMagick-config.
    * Script Magick++-config renamed to GraphicsMagick++-config.
    * Headers installed under ${PREFIX}/include/GraphicsMagick.
    * PerlMagick namespace renamed from "Image::Magick" to
    "Graphics::Magick".
    * Pkgconfig files GraphicsMagick.pc and GraphicsMagick++.pc are
    installed in $libdir/pkgconfig to assist pkg-config users.

  Many performance enhancements:
    * Default QuantumDepth is 8 since this is adequate for most purposes
    and more efficient than 16.
    * The Magick++ demo (compiled with QuantumDepth=8 and -O2) runs about
    1.8X faster under SPARC/Solaris than the same demo with ImageMagick
    5.5.4.
    * Colorspace transformations are much faster.
    * Grayscale/monochrome image handling is much faster.
    * PseudoClass image handling is faster.
    * Text annotations using FreeType are much faster.
    * Image file I/O is much faster.
    * RLE-compressed MIFF reading much faster.

  Code structure enhancements:
    * All utility support functions moved to magick/command.c.
    * Use of MogrifyImage() elminated except for by utilities.
    * Re-builds due to changes to <magick/image.h> reduced by splitting the
    header into multiple headers.
    * ISO C '99 typedefs (gm_int16_t, gm_uint16_t, gm_int32_t, gm_uint32_t,
    gm_int64_t, gm_uint64_t) are available for use.

  Feature enhancements:
    * Module loader always enabled for shared builds to allow extension.
    * SVG coder allows specifying size and initial background color.
    * JPEG-2000 coder (JP2) updated to work with Jasper 1.7.
    * HWB and HSL image colorspace translation support.
    * JNG/MNG/PNG format support tracks ImageMagick version.
    * BMP encoder can write 16-color indexed BMPs now as well as 2-color
    BMPs (not restricted to monochrome).
    * TIFF decoder now includes optimized support for tiled and stripped
    TIFF.

  Major bug fixes:
    * When dithering is disabled, don't dither when converting to a
    PseudoClass, grayscale, or monochrome image. Disabling dithering
    may cause these translations to be much faster.
    * PICON format works with BLOBs.
    * No longer removes input file when pinging a FlashPIX file.
    * Arc drawing and texture fill fixes from ImageMagick.

  Windows platform enhancements:
    * Configure updated for Visual C++ 7.0.
    * OLE object (ImageMagickObject) re-written to work with Visual C++ 7.0
    * New function, CropImageToHBITMAP(), to return a region of the image
    as a Windows HBITMAP.
    * Use vsnprintf to format strings under Windows (safer).

==============================================================
On November 19, 2002, GraphicsMagick was created as a fork of
ImageMagick, several days before the ImageMagick 5.5.2 release.

The objectives of GraphicsMagick are to:

  o Use an open development model.
  o Encourage new developers to join the project.
  o Avoid unnecessary source code "churn".
  o Establish and preserve a stable API.
  o Use efficient coding practices which result in fast code.
  o Improve memory efficiency.
  o Use a release process which assures a working product.
  o Maintain an accurate ChangeLog.
