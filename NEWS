Major changes associated with GraphicsMagick 1.0 (Released May 5, 2003)

  GraphicsMagick support services:

    * FTP via "ftp://ftp.graphicsmagick.org/pub/GraphicsMagick".

  Project maintenance improvements:
    * ChangeLog conforms to the GNU standard and all CVS commits include
    useful log messages.
    * CVS commit messages posted to graphicsmagick-commit mail list.
    * CVS commit messages contain CVSWeb URL references.

  Footprint changes from ImageMagick:
    * Library -lMagick renamed to -lGraphicsMagick.
    * Library -lMagick++ renamed to -lGraphicsMagick++.
    * Utilities consolidated into a single 'gm' utility (e.g. use 'gm
    convert').
    * Script Magick-config renamed to GraphicsMagick-config.
    * Script Magick++-config renamed to GraphicsMagick++-config.
    * Headers installed under ${PREFIX}/include/GraphicsMagick.
    * PerlMagick namespace renamed from "Image::Magick" to "Graphics::Magick".
    * Pkgconfig files GraphicsMagick.pc and GraphicsMagick++.pc are
    installed in $libdir/pkgconfig to assist pkg-config users.
    * Coder modules installed to lib/GraphicsMagick-1.0/modules-Q8/coders.
    * Filter modules installed to lib/GraphicsMagick-1.0/modules-Q8/filters.

  Many performance enhancements:
    * Default QuantumDepth is 8 since this is adequate for most purposes
    and more efficient than 16.
    * The Magick++ demo (compiled with QuantumDepth=8 and -O2) runs about
    1.8X faster under SPARC/Solaris than the same demo with ImageMagick
    5.5.4.
    * Colorspace transformations are much faster.
    * Grayscale/monochrome image handling is much faster.
    * PseudoClass image handling is faster.
    * Text annotations using FreeType are much faster.
    * Image file I/O is much faster.
    * RLE-compressed MIFF reading much faster.

  Code structure enhancements:
    * All utility support functions moved to magick/command.c in order to
    significantly reduce link dependencies, allowing statically-linked
    programs to be smaller.
    * Use of MogrifyImage() elminated except for by utilities.
    * Re-builds due to changes to <magick/image.h> reduced by splitting the
    header into multiple headers.
    * ISO C '99 typedefs (gm_int16_t, gm_uint16_t, gm_int32_t, gm_uint32_t,
    gm_int64_t, gm_uint64_t) are available for use.

  Feature enhancements:
    * Module loader always enabled for shared builds to allow extension.
    * Loading of arbitrary filter modules (via -process option) supported
    under Unix as well as Windows.
    * SVG coder allows specifying size and initial background color.
    * JPEG-2000 coder (JP2) updated to work with Jasper 1.7.
    * HWB and HSL image colorspace translation support.
    * JNG/MNG/PNG format support tracks ImageMagick version.
    * BMP encoder can write 16-color indexed BMPs now as well as 2-color
    BMPs (not restricted to monochrome).
    * TIFF decoder now includes optimized support for tiled and stripped
    TIFF.
    * The -random-threshold option (RandomThresholdImage()) is added to
    threshold an image to bilevel using random thresholding.

  Major bug fixes:
    * 100% successful test completion at all quantum depths (8/16/32).
    * A temporary file management subsystem is added to ensure that all
    temporary files are removed before program exit. Temporary files are
    created and used in a secure fashion to avoid the possibility that a
    "trojan" temporary file (e.g. a symbolic link, or a file containing
    unsafe content) is created before a delegate has the chance to write
    to it. The environment variable MAGICK_TMPDIR allows the user to
    specify where temporary files are created without altering where
    other programs create their temporary files. Temporary filenames are
    created in 8+3 format to hopefully be more acceptable to ralcgm.
    * When dithering is disabled, don't dither when converting to a
    PseudoClass, grayscale, or monochrome image. Disabling dithering
    may cause these translations to be much faster.
    * PICON format works with BLOBs.
    * No longer removes input file when pinging a FlashPIX file.
    * Arc drawing and texture fill fixes from ImageMagick.
    * Sample, scale and affine fixes from ImageMagick.
    * MIFF colormaps are now scaled properly while reading.
    * CMYK translation works for QuantumDepth=32.
    * ConstituteImage now works properly for grayscale images.
    * Built-in tilde expansion and filename globbing now works properly.
    * InitializeMagick now registers signal handlers to ensure that
    resources are released before program exit.  This helps avoid
    temporary file leaks due to the user using "CONTROL-C".
    * The installed <magick/magick_config.h> header now only contains
    the few definitions required by the API headers.  This should
    significantly reduce or eliminate conflicts with other package
    headers.

  Windows platform enhancements:
    * Configure updated for Visual C++ 7.0.
    * OLE object (ImageMagickObject) re-written to work with Visual C++ 7.0
    * New function, CropImageToHBITMAP(), to return a region of the image
    as a Windows HBITMAP.
    * Use vsnprintf to format strings under Windows (safer).

==============================================================
On November 19, 2002, GraphicsMagick was created as a fork of
ImageMagick, several days before the ImageMagick 5.5.2 release.

The objectives of GraphicsMagick are to:

  o Use an open development model.
  o Encourage new developers to join the project.
  o Avoid unnecessary source code "churn".
  o Establish and preserve a stable API.
  o Use efficient coding practices which result in fast code.
  o Improve memory efficiency.
  o Use a release process which assures a working product.
  o Maintain an accurate ChangeLog.
