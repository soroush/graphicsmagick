In late November 2002, GraphicsMagick was created as a branch of
ImageMagick several days before the ImageMagick 5.5.2 release.

The objectives of GraphicsMagick are to:

  o Use an open development model.
  o Encourage new developers to join the project.
  o Avoid unnecessary source code "churn".
  o Establish and preserve a stable API.
  o Use efficient coding practices which result in fast code.
  o Use a release process which assures a working product.
  o Maintain an accurate ChangeLog.
