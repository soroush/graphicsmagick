MACINTOSH MacOS 9 COMPILATION

  The Macintosh distribution contains MetroWerks Codewarrior Professional
  projects for compilation.  For those who do not have access to
  CodeWarrior, the binaries for the command line utilities are enclosed.
  I had to comment the inline intrinsic functions in math.h in order
  to compile.  If you have a better solution, let me know.

  Display(1), animate(1), and import(1) currently do not work on the
  Macintosh.
