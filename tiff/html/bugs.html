Bugs, Bugzilla, and the TIFF Mailing List
</H1>

<P>
This software is free.  Please let us know when you find a problem or
fix a bug.

<P>
Thanks to <A HREF=http://www.remotesensing.org/>remotesensing.org</a>, libtiff now uses bugzilla to track bugs. 
<P>
If you think you've discovered a bug, please first check to see if it is 
already known by looking at the list of already reported bugs.  You can do so 
by visiting the buglist at 
<A HREF=http://bugzilla.remotesensing.org/buglist.cgi?product=libtiff>http://bugzilla.remotesensing.org/buglist.cgi?product=libtiff</A>.  
<p>
If you'd like to enter a new bug, you can do so at <A HREF=http://bugzilla.remotesensing.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=libtiff>http://bugzilla.remotesensing.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=libtiff</A>.  
<P>

Of course, reporting bugs is no substitute for discussion.  A mailing
list for users of this software, and TIFF issues in general, is located 
at olympiakos.com.  If you
want to join this mailing list or have a list-related request such as
getting your name removed from it, send a request to
<A HREF="mailto:tiff-request@olympiakos.com">tiff-request@olympiakos.com</A>.
For example, to subscribe, send the line 
<PRE>
    subscribe
</PRE>
in the body of your message.  The line <TT>help</TT> will return a list of
the commands understood by the mailing list management software.

<P>
Mailing list submissions should be directed to 
<A HREF="mailto:tiff@olympiakos.com">tiff@olympiakos.com</a>.  Only subscribed
list members will be able to submit email to the list.  Administrative
issues requiring a human can be addressed to owner-tiff_at_olympiakos.com (replace _at_ with @). 
When corresponding about this software please always specify what
version you have and what system you are running on.<P>

An archive of several years of list messages is available at
<a href="http://www.remotesensing.org/lists/libtiff_archive/maillist.html">
