.SH NAME
import - capture some or all of an X server screen and save the image to
a file.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "import"
[ \fIoptions\fP ... ] [ \fIfile\fP ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBimport\fP reads an image from any visible window on an X server and
outputs it as an image file.  You can capture a single window, the
entire screen, or any rectangular portion of the screen.  Use
\fBdisplay\fP (see \fBdisplay(1)\fP) for redisplay, printing, editing,
formatting, archiving, image processing, etc. of the captured image.

The target window can be specified by id, name, or may be selected by
clicking the mouse in the desired window.  If you press a button and
then drag, a rectangle will form which expands and contracts as
the mouse moves.  To save the portion of the screen  defined by the
rectangle, just release the button.  The keyboard bell is rung once at
the beginning of the screen capture and twice when it completes.

.SH EXAMPLES

To select an X window with the mouse and save it in the MIFF image
format to a file titled window.miff, use:

.nf
     import window.miff
.fi

To select an X window and save it in the Encapsulated Postscript format
to include in another document, use:

.nf
     import figure.eps
.fi

To capture the entire X server screen in the JPEG image format in a file
titled root.jpeg, use:

.nf
     import -window root root.jpeg
.fi
.SH OPTIONS
\fBimport\fP options can appear on the command line or in your X resources
file (see \fBX(1)\fP).  Options on the command line supersede values specified
in your X resources file.
.TP
.B "-adjoin
join images into a single multi-image file.

By default, all images of an image sequence are stored in the same
file.  However, some formats (e.g. JPEG) do not support more than one image
and are saved to separate files.  Use \fB+adjoin\fP to force this behavior.
.TP
.B "-border"
include image borders in the output image.
.B "-colors \fIvalue\fP"
preferred number of colors in the image.

The actual number of colors in the image may be less than your request,
but never more.  Note, this is a color reduction option.  Images with
less unique colors than specified with this option will have any duplicate
or unused colors removed.
Refer to \fBquantize(9)\fP for more details.

Note, options \fB-dither\fP, \fB-colorspace\fP, and \fB-treedepth\fP affect
the color reduction algorithm.
.TP
.B "-colorspace \fIvalue\fP"
the type of colorspace: \fBGRAY\fP, \fBOHTA\fP, \fBRGB\fP,
\fBTransparent\fP, \fBXYZ\fP, \fBYCbCr\fP, \fBYIQ\fP, \fBYPbPr\fP,
\fBYUV\fP, or \fBCMYK\fP.

Color reduction, by default, takes place in the RGB color space.
Empirical evidence suggests that distances in color spaces such as YUV
or YIQ correspond to perceptual color differences more closely
than do distances in RGB space.  These color spaces may give better
results when color reducing an image.  Refer to \fBquantize(9)\fP for
more details.

The \fBTransparent\fP color space behaves uniquely in that it preserves
the matte channel of the image if it exists.

The \fB-colors\fP or \fB-monochrome\fP option is required for this option
to take effect.
.TP
.B "-comment \fIstring\fP"
annotate an image with a comment.

By default, each image is commented with its file name.  Use this
option to assign a specific comment to the image.  Optionally you can
include the image filename, type, width, height, or scene number by
embedding special format characters.  Embed \fB%f\fP for filename,
\fB%d\fP for directory, \fB%e\fP for filename extention, \fB%t\fP for
top of filename, \fB%m\fP for magick, \fB%w\fP for width, \fB%h\fP for
height, \fB%p\fP for page number, \fB%s\fP for scene number, 
\fB%b\fP for file size, or \fB\\n\fP for newline.  For example,

.nf
     -comment "%m:%f %wx%h"
.fi

produces an image comment of \fBMIFF:bird.miff 512x480\fP for an image
titled \fBbird.miff\fP and whose width is 512 and height is 480.

If the first character of \fIstring\fP is \fB@\fP, the image comment is read
from a file titled by the remaining characters in the string.
.TP
.B "-compress \fItype\fP"
the type of image compression: \fINone\fP, \fIBZip\fP, \fIJPEG\fP, \fILZW\fP,
\fIRunlengthEncoded\fP, or \fIZip\fP.

Specify \fB\+compress\fP to store the binary image in an uncompressed format.
The default is the compression type of the specified image file.
.TP
.B "-crop \fI<width>{%}x<height>{%}{\+-}<x offset>{\+-}<y offset>\fP"
preferred size and location of the cropped image.  See \fBX(1)\fP for details
about the geometry specification.

To specify a percentage width or height instead, append \fB%\fP.  For example
to crop the image by ten percent on all sides of the image, use \fB-crop 10%\fP.

Omit the x and y offset to generate one or more subimages of a uniform size.

Use cropping to crop a particular area of an image.   Use \fB-crop
0x0\fP to trim edges that are the background color.  Add a x and y offset
to leave a portion of the trimmed edges with the image.
.TP
.B "-delay \fI<1/100ths of a second>x<seconds>\fP"
display the next image after pausing.

This option is useful for regulating the display of the sequence of
images.  \fI1/100ths of a second\fP must expire before the display of
the next image.  The default is 6/100 of a second between each frame
of the image sequence.  The second value is optional.  It specifies the
number of \fIseconds\fP to pause before repeating your animation
sequence.
.TP
.B "-density \fI<width>x<height>\fP
vertical and horizontal resolution in pixels of the image.

This option specifies an image density when decoding a Postscript or Portable
Document page.  The default is 72 pixels per inch in the horizontal and
vertical direction.  This option is used in concert with \fB-page\fP.
.TP
.B "-descend"
obtain image by descending window hierarchy.
.TP
.B "-display \fIhost:display[.screen]\fP"
specifies the X server to contact; see \fBX(1)\fP.
.TP
.B "-dispose \fImethod\fP"
GIF disposal method.

Here are the valid methods:

.nf
     0     No disposal specified.
     1     Do not dispose.
     2     Restore to background color.
     3     Restore to previous.
.fi
.TP
.B "-dither"
apply Floyd/Steinberg error diffusion to the image.

The basic strategy of dithering is to trade intensity resolution for
spatial resolution by averaging the intensities of several neighboring
pixels.  Images which suffer from severe contouring when reducing colors
can be improved with this option.

The \fB-colors\fP or \fB-monochrome\fP option is required for this option
to take effect.

Use \fB+dither\fP to render Postscript without text or graphic aliasing.
.TP
.B "-frame"
include window manager frame.
.TP
.B "-geometry \fI<width>{%}x<height>{%}{\+-}<x offset>{\+-}<y offset>{!}{<}{>}\fP"
the width and height of the image.

By default, the width and height are maximum values.  That is, the
image is expanded or contracted to fit the width and height value while
maintaining the aspect ratio of the image.  Append an exclamation point
to the geometry to force the image size to exactly the size you
specify.  For example, if you specify \fB640x480!\fP the image width is
set to 640 pixels and height to 480.  If only one factor is
specified, both the width and height assume the value.

To specify a percentage width or height instead, append \fB%\fP.  The
image size is multiplied by the width and height percentages to obtain
the final image dimensions.  To increase the size of an image, use a
value greater than 100 (e.g. 125%).  To decrease an image's size, use a
percentage less than 100.

Use \fB>\fP to change the dimensions of the image \fIonly\fP
if its size exceeds the geometry specification.  \fB<\fP resizes
the image \fIonly\fP if its dimensions is less than the geometry
specification.  For example, if you specify \fB640x480>\fP and the
image size is 512x512, the image size does not change.  However, if
the image is 1024x1024, it is resized to 640x480.
.TP
.B "-interlace \fItype\fP"
the type of interlacing scheme: \fBNone\fP, \fBLine\fP, \fBPlane\fP, or
\fBPartition\fP.  The default is \fBNone\fP.

This option is used to specify the type of interlacing scheme for raw
image formats such as \fBRGB\fP or \fBYUV\fP.  \fBNo\fP means do not
interlace (RGBRGBRGBRGBRGBRGB...), \fBLine\fP uses scanline
interlacing (RRR...GGG...BBB...RRR...GGG...BBB...), and \fBPlane\fP uses
plane interlacing (RRRRRR...GGGGGG...BBBBBB...).    \fBPartition\fP is like
plane except the different planes are saved to individual files (e.g.
image.R, image.G, and image.B).

Use \fBLine\fP, or \fBPlane\fP to create an interlaced GIF or progressive
JPEG image.
.B "-label \fIname\fP"
assign a label to an image.

Use this option to assign a specific label to the image.  Optionally
you can include the image filename, type, width, height, or scene
number in the label by embedding special format characters.   Embed
\fB%f\fP for filename, \fB%d\fP for directory, \fB%e\fP for filename
extention, \fB%t\fP for top of filename, \fB%m\fP for magick, \fB%w\fP
for width, \fB%h\fP for height, \fB%p\fP for page number, or
\fB%s\fP for scene number, \fB%b\fP for file size in kilobytes, or 
\fB\\n\fP for newline.  For example,

.nf
     -label "%m:%f %wx%h"
.fi

produces an image label of \fBMIFF:bird.miff 512x480\fP for an image
titled \fBbird.miff\fP and whose width is 512 and height is 480.

If the first character of \fIstring\fP is \fB@\fP, the image label is read
from a file titled by the remaining characters in the string.

When converting to Postscript, use this option to specify a header string
to print above the image. Specify the label font with \fB-font\fP.
.TP
.B "-monochrome"
transform image to black and white.
.TP
.B "-negate"
apply color inversion to image.

The red, green, and blue intensities of an image are negated.   Use
\fB+negate\fP to only negate the grayscale pixels of the image.
.TP
.B "-page \fI<width>{%}x<height>{%}{\+-}<x offset>{\+-}<y offset>{!}{<}{>}\fP"
preferred size and location of an image canvas.

Use this option to specify the dimensions of the Postscript page in
dots per inch or a TEXT page in pixels.  The choices for a Postscript page are:

.nf
    Letter      612x 792
    Tabloid     792x1224
    Ledger     1224x 792
    Legal       612x1008
    Statement   396x 612
    Executive   540x 720
    A3          842x1190
    A4          595x 842
    A5          420x 595
    B4          729x1032
    B5          516x 729
    Folio       612x 936
    Quarto      610x 780
    10x14       720x1008
.fi

For convenience you can specify the page size by media (e.g.
A4, Ledger, etc.).  Otherwise, \fB-page\fP behaves much like \fB-geometry\fP
(e.g. -page letter+43+43>).

To position a GIF image, use -page \fI{\+-}<x offset>{\+-}<y offset>\fP
(e.g. -page +100+200).

For a Postscript page, the image is sized as in \fB-geometry\fP and
positioned relative to the lower left hand corner of the page by
\fI{\+-}<x offset>{\+-}<y offset>\fP.  Use -page 612x792>, for example,
to center the image within the page.  If the image size exceeds the
Postscript page, it is reduced to fit the page.

The default page dimensions for a TEXT image is 612x792.

This option is used in concert with \fB-density\fP.
.TP
.B "-pointsize \fIvalue\fP"
pointsize of the Postscript font.
.TP
.B "-quality \fIvalue\fP"
JPEG/MIFF/PNG compression level.

For the JPEG image format, quality is 0 (worst) to 100 (best).  The default
quality is 75.

Quality for the MIFF and PNG image format sets the amount of image compression
(quality / 10) and filter-type (quality % 10).  Compression quality
values range from 0 (worst) to 100 (best).  If filter-type is 4
or less, the specified filter-type is used for all scanlines:

.nf
    0: none
    1: sub
    2: up
    3: average
    4: Paeth
.fi

If filter-type is 5, adaptive filtering is used when quality
is greater than 50 and the image does not have a color map,
otherwise no filtering is used.

If filter-type is 6 or more, adaptive filtering with
\fIminimum-sum-of-absolute-values\fP is used.

The default is quality is 75.  Which means nearly the best compression
with adaptive filtering.

For further information, see the PNG specification (RFC 2083),
<http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/TR>.
.TP
.B "-rotate \fIdegrees{<}{>}\fP"
apply Paeth image rotation to the image.

Use \fB>\fP to rotate the image \fIonly\fP if its width exceeds the
height.  \fB<\fP rotates the image \fIonly\fP if its width is less than
the height.  For example, if you specify \fB-90>\fP and the image size
is 480x640, the image is not rotated by the specified angle.  However,
if the image is 640x480, it is rotated by -90 degrees.

Empty triangles left over from rotating the image are filled with
the color defined as \fBbordercolor\fP (class \fBborderColor\fP).
.TP
.B "-scene \fIvalue\fP"
number of screen snapshots.

Use this option to grab more than one image from the X server screen to create
an animation sequence.
.TP
.B "-screen"
This option indicates that the GetImage request used to obtain the image
should be done on the root window, rather than directly on the specified
window.  In this way, you can obtain pieces of other windows that overlap
the specified window, and more importantly, you can capture menus or other
popups that are independent windows but appear over the specified window.
.TP
.B "-silent"
operate silently, i.e. don't ring any bells.
.TP
.B "-transparency \fIcolor\fP"
make this color transparent within the image.
.TP
.B "-treedepth \fIvalue\fP"
Normally, this integer value is zero or one.  A zero or one tells
\fBconvert\fP to choose a optimal tree depth for the color reduction
algorithm.

An optimal depth generally allows the best representation of the source
image with the fastest computational speed and the least amount of
memory.  However, the default depth is inappropriate for some images.
To assure the best representation, try values between 2 and 8 for this
parameter.  Refer to \fBquantize(9)\fP for more details.

The \fB-colors\fP option is required for this option to take effect.
.TP
.B -verbose
print detailed information about the image.

This information is printed: image scene number;  image name;  image size;
the image class (\fIDirectClass\fP or \fIPseudoClass\fP);  the total
number of unique colors;  and the number of seconds to read and write the
image.
.TP
.B "-window \fIid\fP"
select window with this id or name.

With this option you can specify the target window by id or name rather
than using the mouse.  Specify 'root' to select X's root window as the
target window.
.PP
Options are processed in command line order.
Any option you specify on the command line remains in effect until it is
explicitly changed by specifying the option again with a different effect.

\fIfile\fP specifies the image filename.  If \fIfile\fP is omitted, it defaults
to \fBmagick.ps\fP.  The default image format is Postscript.  To specify a
particular image format, precede the filename with an image format name and a
colon (i.e.  gif:image) or specify the image type as the filename suffix (i.e.
image.jpg).  See \fBconvert(1)\fP for a list of valid image formats.

Specify \fIfile\fP as \fI-\fP for standard output.  If \fIfile\fP has
the extension \fB.Z\fP or \fB.gz\fP, the file size is compressed using
with \fBcompress\fP or \fBgzip\fP respectively.  Precede the image file
name \fI|\fP to pipe to a system command. If \fIfile\fP already exists,
you will be prompted as to whether it should be overwritten.
