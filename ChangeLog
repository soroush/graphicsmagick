	pointer leading to assertion.  Fixes oss-fuzz issue 6067
	"graphicsmagick/coder_CUT_fuzzer: Unknown signal in
	DestroyImageInfo".

	* coders/tga.c (ReadTGAImage): Throw exception rather than
	assertion for unexpected comment size.  Fixes oss-fuzz issue 5961
	"graphicsmagick/coder_ICB_fuzzer: ASSERT: (size_t)
	(tga_info.id_length+1) == commentsize".

2018-02-06  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/pdf.c (WritePDFImage): Free 'xref' allocation before
	error return.  Fixes oss-fuzz issue 5968
	"graphicsmagick/coder_EPDF_fuzzer: Direct-leak in MagickRealloc".

2018-02-04  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/pdb.c (ReadPDBImage): Fix heap buffer overflow if blob is
	already at EOF when comment is read.  Fixes oss-fuzz issue 5997
	"graphicsmagick/coder_PDB_fuzzer: Heap-buffer-overflow in
	SetImageAttribute".

	* coders/dpx.c (ReadDPXImage): Fix memory leak of user data if
	user data is truncated.  Fix consumption of one uninitialized
	stack bytes.  Fixes oss-fuzz issue 5973:

	* coders/pnm.c (ReadPNMImage): Detect and avoid division by zero.
	Fixes Issue 5959 in oss-fuzz: graphicsmagick/coder_P7_fuzzer:
	Divide-by-zero in ReadPNMImage

	* magick/xwindow.c (MagickXClientMessage): Eliminate valgrind
	gripe about use of uninitialized stack data by clearing allocation
	to zero.
	(MagickXMakeImage): Eliminate valgrind gripe about use of
	uninitialized heap data by clearing allocation to zero.

	* coders/pwp.c (ReadPWPImage): Remove bogus EOF test on an image
	with a closed blob.  Fixes Issue 5957 in oss-fuzz:
	graphicsmagick/coder_PWP_fuzzer: ASSERT: image->blob->type !=
	UndefinedStream.

	* www/Changes.rst: Fix typo with spelling "ChangeLog-2017.html".
	Resolves SourceForge issue #544 "dead link 2017 changelog page on
	GraphicsMagick web site".

2018-02-03  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/static.c (OpenModule): Assure that status is initialized.
	Resolves Coverity 261207 "Uninitialized scalar variable".

	* wand/magick_wand.c (MagickHasColormap): New function to test if
	the image has a colormap.
	(MagickIsGrayImage): New function to test if the image uses only
	gray pixels.
	(MagickIsMonochromeImage): New function to test if the image uses
	only monochrome pixels.
	(MagickIsOpaqueImage): New function to test if the image uses only
	opaque pixels.
	(MagickIsPaletteImage): New function to test if the image is based
	on a color palette.  Above functions are written by Troy Patteson

	colormap, is gray image, is monochrome image, is opaque image, is
	palette image".

	* fuzzing: Added initial OSS-Fuzz integration by Alex Gaynor.
	From SourceForge patch #55 "OSS-Fuzz integration"

	* coders/png.c (ReadMNGImage): Fix free using possibly unallocated
	pointer value.

	* magick/blob.c (SeekBlob): Remove implicit extension of blob
	allocation size based on seek offset.  Besides making an
	assumption about how the blob memory was allocated, this
	reallocation feature provides a memory DOS opportunity.  Resolves
	issue reported by Alex Gaynor via email entitled "Security issue
	with memory management in Magick++" to the graphicsmagick-security
	list on 31 Jan 2018.
	(SeekBlob):

	* coders/jpeg.c (ReadIPTCProfile): Revert inadvertent wrong return
	codes added by change on December 9, 2017.  Fixes SourceForge bug
	542 "Improper call to JPEG library in state 201" since 1.3.28.

2018-02-01  Greg Wolfe  <gregory.wolfe@kodakalaris.com>

	* magick/annotate.c (RenderFreetype): Fixed the text
	opacity computation in RenderFreeType(). This bug caused
	the text fill color to bleed into the character cell when
	the SVG "fill-opacity" is less than 1.0.

2018-02-01  Greg Wolfe  <gregory.wolfe@kodakalaris.com>

	* magick/attribute.c (CloneImageAttributes): Fixed a bug
	in which the source image attributes would always replace
	the destination image attributes instead of being appended
	to them, and the destination image attributes would become
	a memory leak.

2018-01-31  Greg Wolfe  <gregory.wolfe@kodakalaris.com>

	* coders/svg.c (SVGStartElement): Fixed a bug in which the
	x,y location values for a <text> or <tspan> were overwritten
	by the x,y values for the next <tspan> before the previous
	values were used.  This caused the text associated with the
	previous <text> or <tspan> to appear at the location
	specified for the next <tspan>.

2018-01-30  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/static.c: Use !defined(SupportMagickModules) to enable
	static module loader.  Fixes SourceForge bug #543 "Multiple
	definition of "OpenModule" (etc) when cross-compiling shared".

2018-01-29  Greg Wolfe  <gregory.wolfe@kodakalaris.com>

	* coders/svg.c (SVGStartElement): A terminating '>' in
	a geometry string is interpreted to mean that the dimensions
	of an image should only be changed if its width or height
	exceeds the geometry specification.  For an unapparent and
	undocumented reason, a terminating '>', if present, was
	being nulled out, making this feature unusable for SVG files
	(now fixed).

2018-01-29  Greg Wolfe  <gregory.wolfe@kodakalaris.com>

	* coders/svg.c (ReadSVGImage): If there is a geometry string
	in image_info->size (e.g., gm convert -size "50x50%" in.svg
	out.png), AllocateImage() sets image->columns and image->rows
	to the width and height values from the size string.  However,
	this makes no sense if the size string was something like
	"50x50%" (we'll get columns = rows = 50).  So we set columns
	and rows to 0 after AllocateImage(), which is the same as if
	no size string was supplied by the client.  This also results
	in svg_info.bounds to be set to 0,0 (i.e., unknown), so that
	svg_info.bounds will later be set using the image size
	information from either the svg "canvas" width/height or from
	the viewbox.  Later, variable "page" is set from
	svg_info->bounds. Then the geometry string in image_info->size
	gets applied to the (now known) "page" width and height when
	SvgStartElement() calls GetMagickGeometry(), and the intended
	result is obtained.


2018-01-24  Greg Wolfe  <gregory.wolfe@kodakalaris.com>

	* coders/svg.c (SVGStartElement): When the density (DPI)
	is specified using the ImageInfo::density member, the derived
	scale factor is incorrectly applied a second time to the
	width and height members of variable RectangleInfo page.
	Fixes SourceForge ticket #451.

2018-01-23  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/static.c: Use a lazy-loader for static modules with the
	same external interface as the lazy-loader for dynamic modules.

2018-01-20  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* NEWS.txt: Prepare for 1.3.28 release.

2018-01-17  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* NEWS.txt: Update with changes since previous release.

2018-01-14  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* PerlMagick/Magick.xs: Compiler warnings reduction.

	* magick/pixel_cache.h: Mark GetPixels(), GetIndexes(), and
	GetOnePixel() as deprecated.  Compilers may produce a warning if
	these functions are used.

	* magick/pixel_cache.c (InterpolateColor): Return black pixel if
	InterpolateViewColor() reports failure.

	* coders/png.c (ReadMNGImage): Fix memory leak of chunk and
	mng_info in error path.

	* coders/gif.c (ReadGIFImage): Fix memory leak of global colormap.

2018-01-13  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/symbols.h: Fix SourceForge issue #538 "13 symbols in
	common with ImageMagick despite --enable-symbol-prefix".

	* coders/bmp.c (ReadBMPImage): Fix non-terminal loop due to
	unexpected bit-field mask value.  Fixes SourceForge issue #541
	"Infinite Loop in ReadBMPImage (coders/bmp.c)".

	* coders/jpeg.c (JPEGMessageHandler): Revert code added on
	2017-07-08 to promote certain warnings from libjpeg to errors.
	Add code to rationalize claimed image dimensions based on file
	size.  Resolves SourceForge issue #539 "Images with libjpeg
	warnings result in error".

2018-01-11  Fojtik Jaroslav  <JaFojtik@seznam.cz>

	* coders/wpg.c Recursive ReadImage could return multiple scenes
          fixed.

2018-01-07  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/png.c (ReadOnePNGImage): Quit 'passes' loop if we
	encountered an error

	* magick/pixel_cache.c (SetNexus): Fix heap overwrite in
	AcquireCacheNexus() due to SetNexus() not using an allocated
	staging area for the pixels like it should.  This problem impacts
	all 1.3.X releases.  Resolves SourceForge issues 532
	"heap-buffer-overflow bug in ReadWPGImage" and #531
	"heap-buffer-overflow in AcquireCacheNexus".

	* magick/pixel_cache.c (InterpolateViewColor): Now returns
	MagickPassFail rather than void.  Code using this function is
	updated to check the return status.

2018-01-01  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/describe.c (DescribeImage): Discriminate between
	AcquireImagePixels() returning NULL or finding a transparent
	pixel.  This avoids use of a null pointer in the case where
	AcquireImagePixels() returns NULL.

2017-12-31  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/static.c: Change static module initialization to be based
	on an initialized list rather than a squence of function calls in
	order to simplify maintenance and possibly address future
	requirements.

2017-12-30  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* Copyright.txt: Bump copyright years and rotate ChangeLog.
