        * magick/monitor.c (MagickMonitorActive): Need to export this
        function for use by modules.

2021-01-30  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

        * VisualMagick/bin: Remove hp2xx.exe, mpeg2dec.exe, and
        mpeg2enc.exe.  There is no value to distributing these pre-built
        and flimsy executables in the source package.

        * filters/analyze.c (AnalyzeImage): Add OpenMP speed-ups.

2021-01-29  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

        * filters/analyze.c (AnalyzeImage): Tidy the structure of the code
        a bit.

        * magick/module.c (ExecuteModuleProcess): Add error reporting for
        the case that the expected symbol is not resolved.

2021-01-23  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

        * configure.ac: Remove updates to use recommended forms of AC_INIT
        and AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE.  There were too many annoying side-effects
        to daily development from these changes.  Perhaps they will be
        re-visited if solutions for Autotools regeneration issues are
        found.

2021-01-19  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

        * magick/render.c (InverseAffineMatrix): Avoid possible division
        by zero or absurdly extreme scaling in InverseAffineMatrix().
        Fixes oss-fuzz 28293 "Divide-by-zero - InverseAffineMatrix".

2021-01-13  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

        * configure.ac (CONFIG_STATUS_DEPENDENCIES): Regenerate
        configure.ac if ChangeLog or version.sh is updated.

2021-01-10  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

        * coders/pdf.c (WritePDFImage): Converting a TIF to a PDF set the
        page MediaBox to the TIFF dimensions in pixels while the CropBox
        is set in local context dimensions. The latter is correct, the
        former is not.  Set the MediaBox to the proper dimension in local
        context.  Should be the same in this context.  Patch by Hubert
        Figuiere and retrieved from SourceForge patch #64 "Incorrect
        MediaBox in PDF export".

        * magick/pixel_cache.c: Memory cache implementation of pixel cache
        now uses resource limited memory allocator.  It was previously
        resource limited, but by using the resource allocation APIs
        directly.

2021-01-09  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

        * coders/tiff.c: Remove unintended double-charging for memory
        resource.  Remove explicit memset where possible.

2021-01-07  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

        * coders/gif.c (ReadGIFImage): Fix memory leak of global_colormap
        if realloc of memory for comment fails.  Fixes oss-fuzz 29316
        "Direct-leak in MagickMalloc".

        * coders/meta.c (ReadMETAImage): Fix double-free if blob buffer
        was reallocated after being attached to blob.  Fixes oss-fuzz
        29193 "Heap-double-free in MagickFree".

2021-01-06  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

        * configure.ac: Updates to use recommended forms of AC_INIT and
        AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE.  This was/is painful due to how development
        snapshot versioning is handled.  The version string produced for
        the snapshot version will now contain the snapshot date.  Effort
        has been made to avoid other impacts due to AC_INIT's enforcements
        for how version information is used.

2021-01-02  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

        * PerlMagick/Magick.xs: Remove GCC warnings which spewed out at
        increased warning levels.

        * magick/magick_types.h.in: Hide definitions not intended for the
        rest of the world under "if defined(MAGICK_IMPLEMENTATION)".

2021-01-01  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

        * configure.ac: Skip library symbol tests for gdi32 since these
        fail with the MSYS2 w64-i686 compiler and well as i686 Cygwin.
        The failures caused a build regression for i686 MSYS2/Cygwin.

        * Copyright.txt: Copyright year updates and ChangeLog rotation for
        the new year.
