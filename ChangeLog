	* magick/magick.c (InitializeMagickSignalHandlers): Use the normal
	termination signal handler for SIGXCPU and SIGXFSZ so that ulimit
	or setrlimit(2) may be used to apply CPU (RLIMIT_CPU) and output
	file size (RLIMIT_FSIZE) limits with the normal cleanup, and
	without dumping core.  Note that any output files currently being
	written may be truncated and files being written by external
	programs (e.g. Ghostscript) might be left behind unless they are
	to a temporary file assigned by GraphicsMagick.

	* coders/xpm.c (ReadXPMImage): Promote a color-lookup
	warning to an error.

	* coders/xc.c (ReadXCImage): Promote a color-lookup
	warning to an error.

	* coders/null.c (ReadNULLImage): Promote a color-lookup
	warning to an error.

	* Makefile.am: Rotate ChangeLogs for the new year.

	* coders/gradient.c (ReadGRADIENTImage): Promote a color-lookup
	warning to an error.
