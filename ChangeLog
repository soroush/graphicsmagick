        * magick/blob.c: Throw a user-friendly exception when the read
        limit has been exceeded.

        length is within the bounds of the scanline allocation to avoid
        possible heap overflow.

        * magick/resource.c: Add support for setting a read resource limit
        via the MAGICK_LIMIT_READ environment variable, or similar to

        * magick/resource.h: Added a ReadResource limit, which is a limit
        on how many uncompressed file bytes may be read while decoding an
        input file.
