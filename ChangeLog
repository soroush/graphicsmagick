	* tiff: Update to libtiff 4.0.8.

2017-03-19  Glenn Randers-Pehrson  <glennrp@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/png.c: Quieted a new Coverity complaint about a potential
	text buffer overrun.

2017-03-19  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/image.c (SetImageInfo): Ignore empty magic prefix
	specification and do not remove colon character from start of
	filename.  Resolves SourceForge bug #415 "Inconsistent Behavior w/
	input_file Parameter".

2017-03-18  Glenn Randers-Pehrson  <glennrp@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/png.c: Added new private orNT PNG chunk, to
	preserve image->orientation when it is defined and not
	the default TopLeft.
	* coders/jpeg.c: Mention image->orientation in the log when
	writing a JPEG.

2017-03-15  Glenn Randers-Pehrson  <glennrp@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/png.c (WriteOnePNGImage): Add version info about
	gm, libpng, zlib, and lcms to the PNG debug log.

2017-03-04  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* magick/command.c (ImportImageCommand): Fix handling of -frame
	options. Option handling was incorrect due to option checking the
	frame option after it had been freed.  Checking the frame dash
	option before freeing the argument solves the problem.  From patch
	provided by Victor Ananjevsky as SourceForge patch #49 "-frame
	doesn't work in gm import".

	* Magick++/lib/Image.cpp (attribute): Added Image attribute method
	which accepts a 'char *' argument, and will remove the attribute
	if the value argument is NULL.  From patch provided by "Gints" as
	SourceForge patch #46 "C++ api - method to clear/remove
	attribute".

	* VisualMagick/configure/configure.cpp (InitInstance): Applied
	patch by Paul McConkey to allow the quantum command line argument
	to set the default value in the wizard drop list.  This allows
	setting the quantum depth when the /nowizard argument was
	supplied.  Resolves SourceForge patch #48 "When running from the
	command line configure.exe does not use the quantum argument".
	The provided configure.exe still needs to be rebuilt to
	incorporate this change.

	* magick/command.c (MogrifyImage): The -orient command now also
	updates the orientation in the EXIF profile, if it exists.

	* Magick++/lib/Image.cpp (orientation): Update orientation in EXIF
	profile, if it exists.

2017-03-03  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/jp2.c: Support PGX JPEG 2000 format for reading and
	writing (within the bounds of what JasPer supports).

2017-02-23  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/tiff.c (QuantumTransferMode): Fix out of bounds read when
	reading CMYKA TIFF which claims to have only 2 samples per pixel.
	Problem was reported via email on February 15, 2017 by Valon
	Chu. This issue was assigned CVE-2017-6335.

2017-01-29  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* doc/options.imdoc (-geometry): Geometry documentation changes
	suggested by Jon Wong.

2017-01-26  Glenn Randers-Pehrson  <glennrp@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/png.c: Added support for a proposed new PNG chunk
	(zxIf, read-only) that is currently being discussed on the
	png-mng-misc at lists.sourceforge.net mailing list.  Enable
	exIf and zxIf with CPPFLAGS="-DexIf_SUPPORTED -DxzIf_SUPPORTED".
	If exIf is enabled, only the uncompressed exIF chunk will be
	written and the hex-encoded zTXt chunk containing the raw Exif
	profile won't be written.

2017-01-25  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/msl.c (MSLStartElement): Change test for NULL image
	pointer to before it is used rather than after it is used.
	Problem reported by Petr Gajdos on 2017-01-25.

2017-01-22  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* TclMagick/unix/m4/tcl.m4: Update tcl.m4 to TEA 3.10.  File
	supplied by Massimo Manghi.

2017-01-21  Glenn Randers-Pehrson  <glennrp@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/png.c: Added support for a proposed new PNG
	chunk (exIf read-write, eXIf read-only) that is currently
	being discussed on the png-mng-misc at lists.sourceforge.net
	mailing list.

2017-01-21  Glenn Randers-Pehrson  <glennrp@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/png.c: Added read_user_chunk_callback() function
	and used it to implement a private PNG caNv (canvas) chunk
	for remembering the original dimensions and offsets when an
	image is cropped.  Previously we used the oFFs chunk for this
	purpose, but this had potential conflicts with other applications
	that also use the oFFs chunk.

2017-01-07  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* TclMagick/Makefile.am (AM_DISTCHECK_CONFIGURE_FLAGS): Applied
	patch by Massimo Manghi to set AM_DISTCHECK_CONFIGURE_FLAGS so
	that 'make distcheck' remembers configuration options, and also to
	uninstall pkgIndex.tcl.

	* magick/image.c (SetImageEx): Use PixelIterateMonoSet() for
	possibly improved efficiency.

	* magick/pixel_iterator.c (PixelIterateMonoSet): New pixel
	iterator intended for use when initializing image pixels, without
	regard to existing values.

2017-01-01  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* Copyright.txt: Bump copyright years and rotate ChangeLog.
