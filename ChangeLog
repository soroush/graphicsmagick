	* magick/command.c (MogrifyImage): The -orient command now also
	updates the orientation in the EXIF profile, if it exists.

	* Magick++/lib/Image.cpp (orientation): Update orientation in EXIF
	profile, if it exists.

	* coders/jp2.c: Support PGX JPEG 2000 format for reading and
	writing (within the bounds of what JasPer supports).

	* coders/tiff.c (QuantumTransferMode): Fix out of bounds read when
	reading CMYKA TIFF which claims to have only 2 samples per pixel.
	Problem was reported via email on February 15, 2017 by Valon
	Chu. This issue was assigned CVE-2017-6335.

	* doc/options.imdoc (-geometry): Geometry documentation changes
	suggested by Jon Wong.

2017-01-26  Glenn Randers-Pehrson  <glennrp@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/png.c: Added support for a proposed new PNG chunk
	(zxIf, read-only) that is currently being discussed on the
	png-mng-misc at lists.sourceforge.net mailing list.  Enable
	exIf and zxIf with CPPFLAGS="-DexIf_SUPPORTED -DxzIf_SUPPORTED".
	If exIf is enabled, only the uncompressed exIF chunk will be
	written and the hex-encoded zTXt chunk containing the raw Exif
	profile won't be written.

2017-01-25  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/msl.c (MSLStartElement): Change test for NULL image
	pointer to before it is used rather than after it is used.
	Problem reported by Petr Gajdos on 2017-01-25.

2017-01-22  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* TclMagick/unix/m4/tcl.m4: Update tcl.m4 to TEA 3.10.  File
	supplied by Massimo Manghi.

2017-01-21  Glenn Randers-Pehrson  <glennrp@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/png.c: Added support for a proposed new PNG
	chunk (exIf read-write, eXIf read-only) that is currently
	being discussed on the png-mng-misc at lists.sourceforge.net
	mailing list.

2017-01-21  Glenn Randers-Pehrson  <glennrp@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* coders/png.c: Added read_user_chunk_callback() function
	and used it to implement a private PNG caNv (canvas) chunk
	for remembering the original dimensions and offsets when an
	image is cropped.  Previously we used the oFFs chunk for this
	purpose, but this had potential conflicts with other applications
	that also use the oFFs chunk.

2017-01-07  Bob Friesenhahn  <bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us>

	* TclMagick/Makefile.am (AM_DISTCHECK_CONFIGURE_FLAGS): Applied
	patch by Massimo Manghi to set AM_DISTCHECK_CONFIGURE_FLAGS so
	that 'make distcheck' remembers configuration options, and also to
	uninstall pkgIndex.tcl.

	* magick/image.c (SetImageEx): Use PixelIterateMonoSet() for
	possibly improved efficiency.

	* magick/pixel_iterator.c (PixelIterateMonoSet): New pixel
	iterator intended for use when initializing image pixels, without
	regard to existing values.

	* Copyright.txt: Bump copyright years and rotate ChangeLog.
