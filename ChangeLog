        * configure.ac: Skip library symbol tests for gdi32 since these
        fail with the MSYS2 w64-i686 compiler and well as i686 Cygwin.
        The failures caused a build regression for i686 MSYS2/Cygwin.

        * Copyright.txt: Copyright year updates and ChangeLog rotation for
        the new year.
