Future Plans</h2></center>
At this early stage in development, there is no reason to artificially
constrain imagination or ambitions. Therefore, I have laid out a challenging
release
plan for Magick++. What actually gets accomplished depends on the level
of support from users and developers. Volunteers are needed. In particular,
work on the CORBA IDL-base API may proceed in parallel with other development.
The following is the tentative development and release plan.
<p><b>1.0 </b>API for operating on individual images and STL containers
of images
<blockquote>This version supports all ImageMagick API operations which
operate on a single image as well as providing <a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/">STL</a>
container support for operating on multiple images (on any STL compatable
container which supports a forward input iterator).</blockquote>

<blockquote>STL is used as the framework in which to store images. Template
functions (e.g. montage)&nbsp; are provided to build the image lists required
by ImageMagick and then invoke the list-oriented ImageMagick API. STL is
quite powerful yet easy to use. At this stage Magick++ has matched what
is currently available/possible using the PerlMagick API due to leveraging
the power of STL.</blockquote>
<b>2.0</b> <a href="http://www.omg.org/">CORBA</a> IDL based client API
with server implementation for executing image processing operations on
a remote (or local) computer.
<blockquote>This version provides a standard CORBA IDL-based API. A C++
wrapper API compatable with that developed for release 2.0 is available
for use by clients. Client wrappers may also be developed for other languages
(e.g. Java). A CORBA server is provided which is implemented in terms of
the Magick++ API in order to satisfy client requests (which may run a different
operating system than the server) . An implementation repository and object
activation is used to instantiate the server upon demand to ensure that
server machines are not unnecessarily burdended. The CORBA ORB employed
is expected to be <a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/TAO.html">TAO</a>
developed by <a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/">Doug Schmidt</a>
(and friends).</blockquote>
<b>3.0</b> Integration of IDL-based API with an existing open source work-queing
system in order to load-share image processing tasks and the image frame
and file level across a large number of machines.
<blockquote>This version is the culmination of the effort. By intelligently
spreading work over many machines, the performance of ImageMagick is magnified.
In order for this to be a success algorithms for efficient transfer of
image data must be developed. Algorithms that take into account processor
afinity and the CPU vs I/O tradeoff for the task to be performed must be
developed. At this point in time, the queuing system to be employed has
not been identified.</blockquote>
