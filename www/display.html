<dl>
<DT><B>-backdrop</B>
<DD>display the image centered on a backdrop.
<P>
<DD>This backdrop covers the entire workstation screen
and is useful for hiding other X window activity
while viewing the image.   The color of the backdrop
is specified as the background color.  Refer to <A HREF="#xres">X
Resources</A> for details.
<P>
<DT><B>-border</B> <I>&lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;</I>
<DD>surround the image with a border of color.  See <b>X(1)</b>
for details about the geometry specification.
<P>
<DD>The color of the border is obtained from the <I>X server</I>
and is defined as <B>bordercolor</B> (class <B>borderColor</B>).
See <b>X(1)</b> for details.
<P>
<dd>See <b>X(1)</b> for details about the color specification.
<P>
<DT><B>-colormap</B> <I>type</I>
<DD>the type of colormap: <B>Shared</B> or <B>Private</B>.
<P>
<DD>This option only applies when the default X server
visual is <I>PseudoColor</I> or <I>GRAYScale</I>.  Refer to <B>-visual</B>
for more details.  By default, a shared colormap is
allocated.  The image shares colors with other X
clients.  Some image colors could be approximated,
therefore your image may look very different than
intended.  Choose <B>Private</B> and the image colors appear
exactly as they are defined.  However, other clients
may go <I>technicolor</I> when the image colormap is
installed.
<P>
<DT><B>-colors</B> <I>value</I>
<DD>preferred number of colors in the image.
<P>
<DD>The actual number of colors in the image may be less
than your request, but never more.  Note, this is a
color reduction option.  Images with less unique
colors than specified with this option will have any duplicate
or unused colors removed.
Refer to <A HREF="../www/quantize.html">quantize</A> for
more details.
<P>
The <B>Transparent</B> color space behaves uniquely in that it preserves
the matte channel of the image if it exists.
<P>
Note, options <B>-dither</B>, <B>-colorspace</B>, and <B>-treedepth</B>
affect the color reduction algorithm.
<P>
<DT><B>-colorspace</B> <I>value</I>
<DD>the type of colorspace: <B>GRAY</B>, <B>OHTA</B>, <B>RGB</B>,
<B>Transparent</B>, <B>XYZ</B>, <B>YCbCr</B>, <B>YIQ</B>, <B>YPbPr</B>,
<B>YUV</B>, or <B>CMYK</B>.
<P>
<DD>Color reduction, by default, takes place in the RGB
color space.  Empirical evidence suggests that
distances in color spaces such as YUV or YIQ
correspond to perceptual color differences more
closely than do distances in RGB space.  These color
spaces may give better results when color reducing an
image.  Refer to <A HREF="../www/quantize.html">quantize</A> for more details.
<P>
The <B>-colors</B> or <B>-monochrome</B> option is required for
this option to take effect.
<P>
<DT><B>-comment</B> <I>string</I>
<DD>annotate an image with a comment.
<P>
<DD>By default, each image is commented with its file
name.  Use this option to assign a specific comment
to the image.  Optionally you can include the image
filename, type, width, height, or scene number by
embedding special format characters.  Embed <tt>%f</tt> for filename,
<tt>%d</tt> for directory, <tt>%e</tt> for filename extention, <tt>%t</tt> for
top of filename, <tt>%m</tt> for magick, <tt>%w</tt> for width, <tt>%h</tt> for 
height, <tt>%p</tt> for page number, <tt>%s</tt> for scene number, or 
<tt>\n</tt> for newline.  For example,
<P>
<pre>
      -comment "%m:%f %wx%h"
</pre>
<P>
<DD>produces an image comment of <tt>MIFF:bird.miff 512x480</tt> for an
image titled <tt>bird.miff</tt> and whose width is 512 and height
is 480.
<P>
<DD>If the first character of <I>string</I> is <I>@</I>, the image comment
is read from a file titled by the remaining characters in
the string.
<P>
<DT><B>-compress</B> <I>type</I>
<DD>the type of image compression: <I>None</I>, <I>BZip</I>, <I>JPEG</I>,
<I>LZW</I>, <I>RunlengthEncoded</I> or <I>Zip</I>.
<P>
<DD>Use this option with <B>-write</B> to specify the the type
of image compression.  See <A HREF="../www/miff.html">miff</A> for
details.
<P>
<DD>Specify <B>+compress</B> to store the binary image in an
uncompressed format.  The default is the compression
type of the specified image file.
<P>
<DT><B>-contrast</B>
<DD>enhance or reduce the image contrast.
<P>
<DD>This option enhances the intensity differences
between the lighter and darker elements of the image.
Use <B>-contrast</B> to enhance the image or <B>+contrast</B> to
reduce the image contrast.
<P>
<DT><B>-crop</B> <I>&lt;width&gt;{%}x&lt;height&gt;{%}{+-}&lt;x
offset&gt;{+-}&lt;y offset&gt;</I>
<DD>preferred size and location of the cropped image.
See <I>X(1)</I> for details about the geometry
specification.
<P>
<DD>To specify a percentage width or height instead,
append <B>%</B>.  For example to crop the image by ten
percent on all sides of the image, use <B>-crop 10%</B>.
<P>
<DD>Use cropping to apply image processing options to, or
display, a particular area of an image.
<p>
<DD>Omit the x and y offset to generate one or more subimages of a uniform size.
<p>
<DD>Use cropping to crop a particular area of an image.   Use <b>-crop
0x0</b> to trim edges that are the background color.  Add a x and y offset
to leave a portion of the trimmed edges with the image.
<p>
The equivalent X resource for this option is
<B>cropGeometry</B> (class <B>CropGeometry</B>).  See <A HREF="#xres">X
Resources</A> for details.
<P>
<DT><B>-delay</B> <I>&lt;1/100ths of a second&gt;</I>
<DD>display the next image after pausing.
<P>
<DD>This option is useful when viewing several images in
sequence.  <I>1/100ths of a second</I> must expire before
the next image is displayed.  The default is to display the
image and wait until you choose to display the next image or
terminate the program.
<P>
<DT><B>-density</B> <I>&lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;</I>
<DD>vertical and horizontal resolution in pixels of the image.
<P>
<DD>This option specifies an image density when decoding
a <I>PostScript</I> or Portable Document page.  The default is the same
as the resolution of your X server (see <b>xdpyinfo(1)</b>).
This option is used in concert with <b>-page</b>.
<P>
<DT><B>-despeckle</B>
<DD>reduce the speckles within an image.
<P>
<DT><B>-display</B> <I>host:display[.screen]</I>
<DD>specifies the X server to contact; see <I>X(1)</I>.
<P>
<dt><b>-dispose</b> <i>method</i>
<dd>GIF disposal method.
<p>
<dd> Here are the valid methods:
<p>
<pre>
      0  No disposal specified.
      1  Do not dispose.      
      2  Restore to background color.
      3  Restore to previous.
</pre>
<P>
<DT><B>-dither</B>
<DD>apply Floyd/Steinberg error diffusion to the image.
<P>
<DD>The basic strategy of dithering is to trade intensity
resolution for spatial resolution by averaging the
intensities of several neighboring pixels.  Images
which suffer from severe contouring when reducing
colors can be improved with this option.
<P>
<DD>The <B>-colors</B> or <B>-monochrome</B> option is required for
this option to take effect.
<P>
<DD>Use <B>+dither</B> to render Postscript without text or graphic aliasing.
<P>
<DT><B>-edge</B> <I>factor</I>
<DD>detect edges within an image.  Specify <I>factor</I> as the percent
enhancement (0.0 - 99.9%).
<P>
<DT><B>-enhance</B>
<DD>apply a digital filter to enhance a noisy image.
<P>
<DT><B>-filter</B> <I>type</I>
<dd>use this type of filter when resizing an image.
<p>
<d>Use this option to affect the resizing operation of an image (see
<b>-geometry</b>).  Choose from these filters:
<p>
<dd><pre>
     Point
     Box
     Triangle
     Hermite
     Hanning
     Hamming
     Blackman

     Cubic
     Catrom
     Mitchell
     Lanczos
     Bessel
     Sinc
</pre>
<p>
<dd>The default filter is <b>Mitchell</b>.
<P>
<DT><B>-flip</B>
<DD>    scanlines in the vertical direction.
<P>
<DT><B>-flop</B>
<DD>    create a "mirror image" by reflecting the image
    scanlines in the horizontal direction.
<P>
<DT><B>-frame</B> <I>&lt;width&gt;x&lt;height+&lt;outer bevel width&gt;+&lt;inner bevel width&gt;</I>
<DD>    surround the image with an ornamental border.  See
 <I>X(1)</I> for details about the geometry specification.
<P>
<DD>    The color of the border is specified with the
    <B>-mattecolor</B> command line option.
<P>
<DT><B>-gamma</B> <I>value</I>
<DD> level of gamma correction.
<P>
<DD>The same color image displayed on two different
workstations may look different due to differences in
the display monitor.  Use gamma correction to adjust
for this color difference.  Reasonable values extend
from <B>0.8</B> to <B>2.3</B>.
<P>
<DD>You can apply separate gamma values to the red,
green, and blue channels of the image with a gamma
value list delineated with slashes (i.e. <B>1.7</B>,<B>2.3</B>,<B>1.2</B>).
<p>
<DD>Use <b>+gamma</b> to set the image gamma level without actually adjusting
the image pixels.  This option is useful if the image is of a known
gamma but not set as an image attribute (e.g. PNG images).
<P>
<DT><B>-geometry</B> <I>&lt;width&gt;{%}x&lt;height&gt;{%}{+-}&lt;x
offset&gt;{+-}&lt;y offset&gt;{!}{&lt;}{&gt;}</I>
<DD> preferred size and location of the <em>image window</em>.  See
<I>X(1)</I> for details about the geometry specification.
By default, the window size is the image size and the
location is chosen by you when it is mapped.
<P>
<DD>By default, the width and height are maximum values.
That is, the image is expanded or contracted to fit
the width and height value while maintaining the
aspect ratio of the image.  Append an exclamation
point to the geometry to force the image size to
exactly the size you specify.  For example, if you
specify <B>640x480!</B> the image width is set to 640 pixels
and height to 480.  If only one factor is specified,
both the width and height assume the value.
<P>
Use <B>&gt;</B> to change the dimensions of the image <em>only</em>
if its size exceeds the geometry specification.  <B>&lt;</B> resizes
the image <em>only</em> if its dimensions is less than the geometry
specification.  For example, if you specify <b>640x480&gt;</b> and the
image size is 512x512, the image size does not change.  However, if
the image is 1024x1024, it is resized to 640x480.
<P>
<DD>To specify a percentage width or height instead,
append %.  The image size is multiplied by the width
and height percentages to obtain the final image
dimensions.  To increase the size of an image, use a
value greater than 100 (e.g. 125%).  To decrease an
image's size, use a percentage less than 100.
<P>
<DD>When displaying an image on an X server, &lt;x offset&gt;
and &lt;y offset&gt; is relative to the root window.
<P>
<DD>The equivalent X resource for this option is <B>geometry</B>
(class <B>Geometry</B>).  See <A HREF="#xres">X Resources</A> for details.
<P>
<DT><B>-interlace</B> <I>type</I>
<DD>the type of interlacing scheme: <B>None</B>, <B>Line</B>, <B>Plane</B>,
or <b>Partition</b>.  The default is <B>None</B>.
<P>
<DD>This option is used to specify the type of interlacing scheme for raw
image formats such as <B>RGB</B> or <B>YUV</B>.  <B>None</B> means do not
interlace (RGBRGBRGBRGBRGBRGB...), <B>Line</B> uses scanline interlacing
(RRR...GGG...BBB...RRR...GGG...BBB...), and <B>Plane</B> uses plane
interlacing (RRRRRR...GGGGGG...BBBBBB...).    <b>Partition</b> is like plane
except the different planes are saved to individual files (e.g.  image.R,
image.G, and image.B).
<P>
<DD>Use <B>Line</B>, or <B>Plane</B> to create an <B>interlaced GIF</B> 
or <B>progressive JPEG</b> image.
<P>
<DT><B>-immutable</B>
<DD>displayed image cannot be modified.
<P>
<DT><B>-label</B> <I>string</I>
<DD>assign a label to an image.
<P>
<DD>Use this option to assign a specific label to the
image.  Optionally you can include the image
filename, type, width, height, or scene number in the
label by embedding special format characters. Embed <tt>%f</tt> for filename,
<tt>%d</tt> for directory, <tt>%e</tt> for filename extention, <tt>%t</tt> for
top of filename, <tt>%m</tt> for magick, <tt>%w</tt> for width, <tt>%h</tt> for 
height, <tt>%p</tt> for page number, <tt>%s</tt> for scene number, or
<tt>\n</tt> for newline.  For example,
<P>
<PRE>
      -label "%m:%f %wx%h"
</PRE>
<DD>produces an image label of <tt>MIFF:bird.miff 512x480</tt> for an
image titled <tt>bird.miff</tt> and whose width is 512 and height
is 480.
<P>
<DD>If the first character of <I>string</I> is <I>@</I>, the image label is
read from a file titled by the remaining characters in the
string.
<P>
<DD>When converting to <I>PostScript</I>, use this option to specify
a header string to print above the image.  Specify the label font with
<b>-font</b>.
<P>
<DT><B>-map</B> <I>type</I>
<DD>display image using this <I>Standard Colormap</I> type.
<P>
<DD>Choose from these <I>Standard Colormap</I> types:
<PRE>

      red
      green
      blue
</PRE>
<P>
<DD>The <I>X server</I> must support the <I>Standard Colormap</I> you
choose, otherwise an error occurs.  Use <B>list</B> as the type
and <B>display</B> searches the list of colormap types in <B>top-to-bottom</B>

<P>
<DT><B>-monochrome</B>
<DD>transform the image to black and white.
<P>
<DT><B>-negate</B>
<DD>apply color inversion to image.

pixels.  The choices for a Postscript page are:
<PRE>
   Letter      612x 792

</PRE>
<DD>For convenience you can specify the page size by media
(e.g. A4, Ledger, etc.).  Otherwise, <b>-page</b> behaves much like
<b>-geometry</b> (e.g. <tt>-page letter+43+43&gt</tt>).
<p>
<dd>To position a GIF image, use <b>-page</b>
<i>{+-}&lt;x offset&gt;{+-}&lt;y offset&gt;</i>
(e.g. -page +100+200).  
<p>
<dd>For a Postscript page, the image is sized as in <b>-geometry</b> and
positioned relative to the lower left hand corner of the page by
{+-}&lt;<B>x</B> <EM>offset</EM>&gt;{+-}&lt;<B>y</B> <EM>offset</EM>&gt;.
Use <tt>-page 612x792&gt</tt>, for example, to center the image within the
page.  If the image size exceeds the Postscript page, it is reduced to fit the
page.
<p>
<dd>The default page dimensions for a TEXT image is 612x792.
<p>
<dd>This option is used in concert with <b>-density</b>.
<P>
<DT><B>-quality</B> <I>value</I>
<DD>JPEG/MIFF/PNG compression level.
<P>
<DD> For the JPEG image format, quality is 0 (worst) to 100 (best).
The default quality is 75.
<p>
<dd> Quality for the MIFF and PNG image format sets the amount of image compression 
(quality / 10) and filter-type (quality % 10).  Compression quality
values range from 0 (worst) to 100 (best).  If filter-type is 4
or less, the specified filter-type is used for all scanlines:
<p>
<pre>
    0: none
    1: sub
    2: up
    3: average
    4: Paeth
</pre>
<p>
<dd>If filter-type is 5, adaptive filtering is used when quality
is greater than 50 and the image does not have a color map,
otherwise no filtering is used.
<p>
<dd>If filter-type is 6 or more, adaptive filtering with 
<em>minimum-sum-of-absolute-values</em> is used.
<p>
<dd>The default is quality is 75.  Which means nearly the best compression
with adaptive filtering.

<DD>width and height of the image.
<P>
<DD>Use this option to specify the width and height of
raw images whose dimensions are unknown such as <B>GRAY</B>,
<B>RGB</B>, or <B>CMYK</B>.  In addition to width and height, use
<B>-size</B> to skip any header information in the image tell the
number of colors in a <B>MAP</B> image file, (e.g. -size 640x512+256).
<P>
<DD>For Photo CD images, choose from these sizes:

<DT><B>-title</B> <I>string</I>
<DD>assign a title to the displayed image.
<P>
<DD>Use this option to assign a specific title to the image.  This is
assigned to the image window and is typically displayed in the window
title bar.  Optionally you can include the image filename, type, width,
height, or scene number in the label by embedding special format
characters.   Embed <tt>%f</tt> for filename, <tt>%d</tt> for directory,
<tt>%e</tt> for filename extention, <tt>%t</tt> for top of filename,
<tt>%m</tt> for magick, <tt>%w</tt> for width, <tt>%h</tt> for height,
<tt>%p</tt> for page number, <tt>%s</tt> for scene number, or <tt>%b</tt> for

<P>
<DT><B>-treedepth</B> <I>value</I>
<DD>Normally, this integer value is zero or one.  A zero
or one tells display to choose a optimal tree depth
for the color reduction algorithm.
<P>
<DD>An optimal depth generally allows the best
representation of the source image with the fastest
computational speed and the least amount of memory.
However, the default depth is inappropriate for some
images.  To assure the best representation, try
values between 2 and 8 for this parameter.  Refer to
 <A HREF="../www/quantize.html">quantize</A> for more details.
<P>
<DD>The <B>-colors</B> or <B>-monochrome</B> option is required for
this option to take effect.
<P>
<DT><B>-update</B> <I>seconds</I>
<DD>detect when image file is modified and redisplay.
<P>
<DD>Suppose that while you are displaying an image the

<P>
<DD>This information is printed: image scene number;
image name;  image size; the image class (<I>DirectClass</I>
or <I>PseudoClass</I>);  the total number of unique colors;
and the number of seconds to read and transform the
image.  Refer to <A HREF="../www/miff.html">miff</A> for a description
of the image class.
<P>
<DD>If <B>-colors</B> is also specified, the total unique colors

description of these values.
<P>
<DT><B>-visual</B> <I>type</I>

<PRE>
      StaticGray
      GrayScale
      StaticColor
      PseudoColor
      TrueColor
      DirectColor
      default
      <I>visual id</I>
</PRE>
<DD>The <I>X server</I> must support the visual you choose, otherwise
an error occurs.  If a visual is not specified, the visual
class that can display the most simultaneous colors on the
default <I>X server</I> screen is chosen.
<P>
<DT><B>-window</B> <I>id</I>
<DD>set the background pixmap of this window to the
image.
<P>
<DD><I>id</I> can be a window id or name.  Specify <B>root</B> to
select X's root window as the target window.
<P>
<DD>By default the image is tiled onto the background of
the target window.   If <B>-backdrop</B> or <B>-geometry</B> are
specified, the image is surrounded by the background
color.  Refer to <A HREF="#xres">X Resources</A> for details.
<P>
<DD>The image will not display on the root window if the
image has more unique colors than the target window
colormap allows.  Use <B>-colors</B> to reduce the number of
colors.
<P>
<DT><B>-window_group</B> <I>id</I>
<DD>exit program when this window id is destroyed.
<P>
<DD><I>id</I> can be a window id or name.
<P>
<DT><B>-write</B> <I>filename</I>
<DD>write image to a file.
<P>
<DD>If <I>file</I> already exists, you will be prompted as to
whether it should be overwritten.
<P>
<DD>By default, the image is written in the format that
it was read in as.  To specify a particular image
format, prefix <I>file</I> with the image type and a colon
(i.e. ps:image) or specify the image type as the
filename suffix (i.e. image.ps).  See convert(1) for
a list of valid image formats.  Specify file as - for
standard output.  If file has the extension <B>.Z</B> or
<B>.gz</B>, the file size is <B>compressed</B> using with compress
or <B>gzip</B> respectively.  Precede the image file name |
to pipe to a system command. If <I>file</I> already exists,
you will be prompted as to whether it should be
overwritten.
</dl>
<P>
<dt>Use <B>-compress</B> to specify the type of image
compression.
<P>
<dt>The equivalent X resource for this option is
<B>writeFilename</B> (class <B>WriteFilename</B>).  See <A HREF="#xres">X
Resources</A> for details.
<P>
<DT>In addition to those listed above, you can specify these
standard X resources as command line options:
<B>-background</B>, <B>-bordercolor</B>, <B>-borderwidth</B>, <B>-font</B>,
<B>-foreground</B>, <B>-iconGeometry</B>, <B>-iconic</B>,
<B>-mattecolor</B>, <B>-name</B>, or <B>-title</B>.  
See <A HREF="#xres">X Resources</A> for details.
<P>
<DT>Options are processed in command line order.  Any option
you specify on the command line remains in effect until it
is explicitly changed by specifying the option again with
a different effect.  For example to display two images,
the first with 32 colors, and the second with only 16
colors, use:
<PRE>
      display -colors 32 cockatoo.miff -colors 16 macaw.miff
</PRE>
<P>
<DT>By default, the image format is determined by its magic
number. To specify a particular image <A
HREF="../www/formats.html">format</A>, precede the filename with an
image format name and a colon (i.e.  ps:image) or specify the image type as the
filename suffix (i.e. image.ps).
<P>
<DT>When you specify <B>X</B> as your image type, the filename has
special meaning.  It specifies an X window by id, name, or
<B>root</B>.  If no filename is specified, the window is selected
by clicking the mouse in the desired window.
<P>
<DT>Specify file as - for standard input.  If file has the
extension <B>.Z</B> or <B>.gz</B>, the file is uncompressed with
<B>uncompress</B> or <B>gunzip</B> respectively.  Precede the image file
name | to pipe from a system command.
<P>
<DT>Use an optional index enclosed in brackets after a file name to specify
a desired subimage of a multi-resolution image format like Photo CD
(e.g. <tt>img0001.pcd[4]</tt>) or a range for MPEG images (e.g.
<tt>video.mpg[50-75]</tt>).  A subimage specification can be disjoint
(e.g. <tt>image.tiff[2,7,4]</tt>).  For raw images, specify a subimage with
a geometry (e.g.  <tt>-size 640x512 image.rgb[320x256+50+50]</tt>).
<P>
<DT>Single images are read with the filename you specify.
Alternatively, you can display an image sequence with a
single filename.  Define the range of the image sequence
with -scene.  Each image in the range is read with the
filename followed by a period (<tt>.</tt>)  and the scene number.
You can change this behavior by embedding a <tt>printf</tt> format
specification in the file name.  For example,
<pre>
    -scene 0-9 image%02d.miff
</pre>
displays files <tt>image00.miff</tt>, <tt>image01.miff</tt>, through
<tt>image09.miff</tt>.

<P>
<DD>The image compositor requires a matte, or alpha channel in
the image for some operations.  This extra channel usually
defines a mask which represents a sort of a cookie-cutter
for the image.  This is the case when matte is 255 (full
coverage) for pixels inside the shape, zero outside, and
between zero and 255 on the boundary.  If image does not
have a matte channel, it is initialized with 0 for any
pixel matching in color to pixel location (0,0), otherwise
255.  See <A HREF="#matt">Matte Editing</A> for a method of defining a matte
channel.
<P>
<DD>Note that matte information for image window is not
retained for colormapped X server visuals (e.g.  <I>StaticColor, StaticColor,
GrayScale, PseudoColor</I>).  Correct compositing behavior may require a
<I>TrueColor</I> or <I>DirectColor</I> visual or a <I>Standard Colormap</I>.
<P>
<DD>Choosing a composite operator is optional.  The default
operator is replace.  However, you must choose a location
to composite your image and press button 1.  Press and
hold the button before releasing and an outline of the
image will appear to help you identify your location.
<P>
<DD>The actual colors of the pasted image is saved.  However,
the color that appears in image window may be different.
For example, on a monochrome screen image window will
appear black or white even though your pasted image may
have many colors.  If the image is saved to a file it is
written with the correct colors.  To assure the correct
colors are saved in the final image, any <I>PseudoClass</I> image
is promoted to <I>DirectClass</I>.  To force a

<DT>Image Segmentation
</A>
</H2>
<DD> Choose <B>Effects-&gt;segment</B> to segment an image by analyzing the
histograms of the color components and identifying units that are homogeneous
with the fuzzy c-means technique.  The scale-space filter
analyzes the histograms of the three color components of the
image and identifies a set of classes.  The extents of each
class is used to coarsely segment the image with
thresholding.  The color associated with each class is
determined by the mean color of all pixels within the
extents of a particular class.  Finally, any unclassified
pixels are assigned to the closest class with the fuzzy c-means technique.
<P>
The fuzzy c-Means algorithm can be summarized as follows:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Build a histogram, one for each color component of
the image.
<P>
<LI>For each histogram, successively apply the scale-
space filter and build an interval tree of zero
crossings in the second derivative at each scale.
Analyze this scale-space ``fingerprint'' to determine
which peaks or valleys in the histogram are most
predominant.
<P>
<LI>The fingerprint defines intervals on the axis of the
histogram.  Each interval contains either a minima or a
maxima in the original signal.  If each color component
lies within the maxima interval, that pixel is
considered ``classified'' and is assigned an unique
class number.
<P>
<LI>Any pixel that fails to be classified in the above
thresholding pass is classified using the fuzzy c-Means
technique.  It is assigned to one of the classes
discovered in the histogram analysis phase.
</UL>
<P>
<DD>The fuzzy c-Means technique attempts to cluster a pixel by
finding the local minima of the generalized within group sum
of squared error objective function.  A pixel is assigned to
the closest class of which the fuzzy membership has a
maximum value.

<DD>The image compositor requires a matte, or alpha channel in
the image for some operations.  This extra channel usually
defines a mask which represents a sort of a cookie-cutter
for the image.  This is the case when matte is 255 (full
coverage) for pixels inside the shape, zero outside, and
between zero and 255 on the boundary.  If image does not
have a matte channel, it is initialized with 0 for any
pixel matching in color to pixel location (0,0), otherwise
255.  See <A HREF="#matt">Matte Editing</A> for a method of defining a matte
channel.
<P>
<DD>If you choose <b>blend</b>, the composite operator becomes <b>over</b>.
The image matte channel percent transparency is
initialized to factor.  The image window is initialized to
(100-factor).  Where factor is the value you specify in
the Dialog widget.
<p>
<DD><b>Displace</b> shifts the image pixels as defined by a displacement map.
With this option, <i>image</i> is used as a displacement map.
Black, within the displacement map, is a maximum positive displacement.  White
is a maximum negative displacement and middle gray is neutral.  The displacement
is scaled to determine the pixel shift.  By default, the displacement applies
in both the horizontal and vertical directions.  However, if you specify
<i>mask</i>, <i>image</i> is the horizontal X displacement and
<i>mask</i> the vertical Y displacement.
<P>
<DD>Note that matte information for image window is not
retained for colormapped X server visuals (e.g.
<I>StaticColor, StaticColor, GrayScale, PseudoColor</I>).
Correct compositing behavior may require a <I>TrueColor</I> or
<I>DirectColor</I> visual or a <I>Standard Colormap</I>.
<P>
<DD>Choosing a composite operator is optional.  The default
operator is replace.  However, you must choose a location
to composite your image and press button 1.  Press and
hold the button before releasing and an outline of the
image will appear to help you identify your location.
<P>
<DD>The actual colors of the composite image is saved.
However, the color that appears in image window may be
different.  For example, on a monochrome screen Image
window will appear black or white even though your
composited image may have many colors.  If the image is
saved to a file it is written with the correct colors.  To
assure the correct colors are saved in the final image,
any PseudoClass image is promoted to <I>DirectClass</I> (see

<P>
<DD>Choose a stipple, if appropriate, from the <B>Stipple</B> sub-menu.
Additional stipples can be specified with the file browser.
Stipples obtained from the file browser must be on disk in the

<P>
<DD>Choose a point in the image window and press button 1 and
hold.  Next, move the pointer to another location in the
image.  As you move, a line connects the initial location
and the pointer.  When you release the button, the image
is updated with the primitive you just drew.
For polygons, the image is updated when you press and release the button
without moving the pointer.

<dt><b>apply Floyd/Steinberg error diffusion to image</b>
<dd>The basic strategy of dithering is to trade intensity resolution
for spatial resolution by averaging the intensities of several
neighboring pixels.  Images which suffer from severe contouring when
reducing colors can be improved with this perference.
</dl>
<p>
<dl>
<dt><b>use a shared colormap for colormapped X visuals</b>
<dd>This option only applies when the default X server visual is
<I>PseudoColor</I> or <i>GRAYScale</i>.  Refer to <B>-visual</B> for
more details.  By default, a shared colormap is allocated.  The image
shares colors with other X clients.  Some image colors could be
approximated, therefore your image may look very different than
intended.  Otherwise the image colors appear exactly as they are
defined.  However, other clients may go technicolor when the image
colormap is installed.
</dl>
<p>
<dl>
<dt><b>display images as an X server pixmap</b>
<dd>Images are maintained as a XImage by default.  Set this resource to
True to utilize a server Pixmap instead.  This option is useful if your
image exceeds the dimensions of your server screen and you intend to
pan the image.  Panning is much faster with Pixmaps than with a
XImage.  Pixmaps are considered a precious resource, use them with
discretion.
