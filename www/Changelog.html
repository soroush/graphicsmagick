    an image in any of the more popular image formats including GIF, JPEG,

    making it suitable for Web applications.  You can also resize, rotate,
    sharpen, color reduce, or add special effects to an image and save your
    completed work in the same or  differing image format.">

<h3>
<a href="../ImageMagick.html">ImageMagick</a> 5.1.1, January 1, 2000</h3>

<ul>
<li> Image sizes are limited by physical memory plus available disk
space on the machine, or the file addressing limits of the
operating system, whichever comes first. This means that if you
can figure out how to build a big enough machine (and have
plenty of time) terabyte images can be processed.
<p>
<li> An image cache subsystem and API are provided to map portions
(as small as one pixel or as large as the entire image) of
images into memory and to save any updates.
<p>

<li> Memory mapping is used to access files. This is the most
efficient access mechanism available.
<p>

<li> DirectColor pixels are now stored in an efficient 32-bit
structure (or 64-bit when QuantumLeap is enabled).
<p>

<li> PseudoColor indices are now stored separately from the
DirectColor pixels (PseudoColor and DirectColor representations
are still available simultaneously).
<p>

<li> In-memory run-length encoding is eliminated.
<p>

<li> Compressed images are decompressed and compressed incrementally
in order to limit memory consumption.
<p>

<li> Lots of minor C API fixes and improvements.
<p>

<li> Cache threshold setting for setting the boundary between use of
RAM or RAM + disk when processing an image:
<p>
- Use the --enable-cache option (e.g. --enable-cache=160) to
  set the compiled-in default when running the configure script.
<p>

- Use -cache for ImageMagick utilities
<p>

- Set the cache_threshold attribute in PerlMagick
<p>

- Set the cacheThreshold attribute in Magick++
<p>

<li> The identify utility now displays precise read-time values.

<p>
<li> The Win32 build environment (now called "VisualMagick") is
completely re-done and supports building both multi-thread DLL
as well as static libraries.

</ul>
