You can also resize, rotate,    sharpen, color reduce, or add special effects to an image and save your    completed work in the same or  differing image format.">

<p>
<dd>Under Unix and Windows, dynamically-loaded format <i>coder</i> modules are
supported. There are currently 72 loadable modules. Support for
loadable modules allows the user to add or remove formats from
ImageMagick by simply adding or removing a file. New modules are
automatically detected so users may add their own modules. This support
is proven to work for Sun Solaris, Linux, and SGI IRIX.  Please let us
know about other operating systems they work on.  Building a modular
ImageMagick is enabled by specifing the configure options
<tt>--enable-shared --with-modules</tt>.
</dd>
<p>

<dd>
ImageMagick now has a set of modules for streaming.  Here pixels are
passed to the application as they are available and deleted after use ensuring
a small memory footprint.  This is useful for multi-media applications such as
MPEG.
</dd>
<p>

<dd>Image format identification (based on the file header) is now
configured via an external text file. This allows the user to add
automatic file identification for new formats added via a coder module,
or via a delegate (external program).</dd>
<p>

<dd>XML files conforming to the W3C SVG DTD are now rendered directly by
ImageMagick.  The support is incomplete but still useful.</dd>
<p>

<dd>The Pilot Image Format (PDB) is now supported.</dd>
<p>

<dd>The drawing primitives have been extended to support drawing bezier
curves, rounded rectangles, and arcs. There is now support for drawing
compound objects (a sequence of objects) using drawing paths.  The
concept of a drawing <tt>pen</tt> has been split into <tt>stroke</tt> (for the
outline) and <tt>fill</tt> (for the objects internal color). If fill is not
defined, then only the object outline is drawn. This substantial change
results in the existing drawing commands for filled objects
(fillEllipse, fillRectangle, fillCircle, and fillPolygon) being
deprecated.</dd>
<p>

<dd>A <i>cache</i> file format is now supported which is a snapshot of an
image's pixel cache as it appears on disk. Images stored in this format
(large) may be loaded <i>instantly</i> by ImageMagick since decoding is not
required. In order to write this format , the argument <tt>-cache 0</tt> must
be supplied (e.g. <tt>convert -cache 0 file.jpg file.cache</tt>).</dd>
<p>

<dd>The build environment for Windows NT is entirely re-done. There is now
a <tt>configure</tt> program which generates a set of Visual C++ project files
which satisfy a set of reqirements (e.g. DLL, multi-thread, X11). These
project files are then used to build ImageMagick.</dd>
<p>

<dd>The C API is significantly modified in order to provide thread-safe
operation via function re-entrancy. ImageMagick is believed to be
thread-safe when used with POSIX threads. It is not yet completely
thread safe under Windows or the Mac. Errors (of type ExceptionInfo)
are now reported by a function argument, or via a member of the current
image.</dd>
<p>

<dd>The GaussianBlurImage() function (contributed by
<tt>runger@cs.mcgill.ca</tt>) supports Gaussian bluring an image.</dd>
<p>

<dd>Functions (OpenCacheView(), CloseCacheView(), GetCacheView(),
SetCacheView(), and SyncCacheView()) are provided in order to support
manipulating multiple pixel views.</dd>
