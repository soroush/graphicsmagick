With ImageMagick you can create GIFs dynamically    making it suitable for Web applications.  You can also resize, rotate,    sharpen, color reduce, or add special effects to an image and save your    completed work in the same or  differing image format.">

<h3>
<a href="../ImageMagick.html">ImageMagick</a> 5.2.0, June 1, 2000</h3>
<h4>
&nbsp;<a NAME="User Visible Changes"></a>User Visible Changes</h4>

<blockquote>
<li>
Under Unix, format "coder" modules may be built and installed (by default)
to <tt>/usr/local/lib/ImageMagick/modules/coders</tt> when <i>configure</i>
option '<tt>--with-modules</tt>' is specified. Coder modules are detected
and loaded at run-time. Use of coder modules removes knowledge of specific
image formats from the ImageMagick library, decreases installation dependencies,
and allows users to add support for new formats without re-compiling ImageMagick.
ImageMagick currently has a total of 72 coder modules. ImageMagick looks
for modules in its installation directory, in the sub-directory ".<tt>magick</tt>"
in the user's home directory, and in the list of directories specified
by the environment variable <tt>MAGICK_MODULE_PATH</tt>.</li>

<li>
Module loading is also fully supported under Microsoft Windows.</li>

<li>
Image file identification based on the file header (magic) is now programmed
via a text file (magic.mgk) rather than embedded in the C code. This allows
extending ImageMagick's knowledge of file types without modifying ImageMagick
itself.</li>

<li>
XML files conforming to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/">W3C
SVG DTD</a> are now rendered directly by ImageMagick. Support is exploratory
at this time, and will likely be re-implemented later.</li>

<li>
The drawing primitives have been extended to support drawing bezier curves,
rounded rectangles, and arcs. There is now support for drawing compound
objects (a sequence of objects) using drawing paths. The concept of a drawing
"<i>pen</i>" has been split into "<i>stroke</i>" (for the outline) and
"<i>fill</i>" for the objects internal color. If <i>fill</i> is not defined,
then only the object outline is drawn. This substantial change results
in the existing drawing commands for filled objects (<i>fillEllipse</i>,
<i>fillRectangle</i>, <i>fillCircle</i>, and <i>fillPolygon</i>) being
deprecated.</li>

<li>
ImageMagick now supports writing a "cache" format which is a snapshot of
ImageMagick's disk-backed pixel cache (disk usage is approximately&nbsp;
rows x columns x 4 x sizeof(Quantum)). Use of the native cache format avoids
the image decode step entirely (image pixels are memory-mapped, and accessed
as required) and can be used to&nbsp; accelerate repeated accesses to a
large image.</li>

<li>
The build environment for Windows NT is entirely re-done.&nbsp; There is
now a "configure" program which generates a set of Visual C++ project files
which satisfy a set of reqirements (e.g. DLL, multi-thread, X11). These
project files are then used to build ImageMagick.</li>
</blockquote>

<h4>
&nbsp;<a NAME="C API Changes"></a>C API Changes</h4>

<blockquote>There have been substantial C API changes in order to support
thread-safety through API reentrancy, improvements to the interface, and
support for multiple pixel views.
<p>API changes include:</blockquote>

<ul>
<ul>
<li>
The addition of an <i>ExceptionInfo</i> parameter for methods which return
an image, which records any reported error.</li>

<li>
The addition of an exception member (of type <i>ExceptionInfo</i>) to the
Image structure to record any reported error for methods which update the
image.</li>

<li>
New method <i>GetImageException()</i> supports retrieving any reported
errors from an Image sequence.</li>

<li>
Existing methods <i>BlurImage()</i>, <i>EdgeImage()</i>, <i>EmbossImage()</i>,
<i>ReduceNoiseImage()</i>,
and <i>SharpenImage()</i> take an entirely different form of specifying
the degree of sharpening or blurring (based on the radius of the pixel
region rather than a meaningless percentage).</li>

<li>
New method <i>GaussianBlurImage()</i> added to Gaussian blur an image.</li>

<li>
New methods <i>OpenCacheView()</i>, <i>CloseCacheView()</i>, <i>GetCacheView()</i>,
<i>SetCacheView()</i>,
and <i>SyncCacheView()</i> added in order to support manipulating multiple
pixel views.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<h4>
<a NAME="Implementation Changes"></a>Implementation Changes</h4>

<ul>
<li>
The Image cache subsystem is re-worked in order to improve performance
and to support multiple pixel views.</li>

<li>
The primary mechanism for reporting errors is different in order to support
thread safety via re-entrancy.</li>
</ul>
