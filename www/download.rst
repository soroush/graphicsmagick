GraphicsMagick Download

The source distribution of GraphicsMagick as well as pre-compiled
binaries may be downloaded from the `SourceForge Download`_ page.

Until recently (December, 2021) GraphicsMagick provided its own ftp
site for downloads but this has been disabled due to abusive download
practices and because support for FTP has been removed from popular
browsers.  This is unfortunate since the same site also provided
PNG-related files and a libtiff mirror.  The ftp site directory tree
continues to exist and will be maintained.  If you are an
administrator of a high-bandwidth ftp or https mirror site and would
like to provide a GraphicsMagick mirror, please contact `Bob
Friesenhahn`_ and we will work something out.
