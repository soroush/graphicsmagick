ImageMagick, version 4.2.3, source and binary distribution is available
for a limited time on CD.  The CD includes everything that is found at the 
<a href="ftp://204.183.81.131/pub/ImageMagick/">ImageMagick</a>
<tt>ftp</tt> site including Unix, Linux, NT, Win95, and VMS binaries, as well
as PerlMagick, WebMagick, and the delegates.  To receive the CD, send $7.50 in
US funds (check or money order made out to <tt>John Cristy</tt>) and a
self-addressed stamped envelope large enough to accomodate a CD to
<p>
<pre>
    ImageMagick
    P.O. Box 40
    Landenberg, PA  19350
    USA
</pre>
<p>
If you don't have access to US stamps, please include additional money 
to cover the cost of postage (be sure to include the self-addressed 
envelope).
<p>
You must follow these instructions exactly to receive your CD.  Allow for
a one week turnaround although it may be less.
<p>
All proceeds from the CD will be donated to the 
<a href="http://www.specialolympics.com/">Special Olympics</a>.
<p>
Thanks goes to
<a href="mailto:lightmanaj@earthlink.net">Arthur Jerijian</a> for volunteering
to burn these CD's.  Another person contributed CD's as well but they wish
to remain anonymous.
<p>
Note, I have 50 ImageMagick CD's left.  When they are gone I cannot guarentee
that more will be produced.
