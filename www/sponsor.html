ImageMagick has been available to both free and commercial users since
the early 1990's. In early 1993 it was one of the strongest free image
processing packages available, but, unlike competing packages, it continues
to be supported and enhanced. Today, ImageMagick is stronger and better
supported than ever.
<p>ImageMagick has enjoyed considerable support from commercial users.
Since ImageMagick is not restricted from use in commercial or proprietary
applications, it is used to support thousands of commercial web sites,
is used by professional digital image and publishing shops, and is used
as a component of commercial applications. Many of these commercial users
have made contributions to ImageMagick, large and small, often anonymous,
but always appreciated.
<p>ImageMagick Studio LLC is now looking for sponsorship from companies which
use ImageMagick, or which would like to help support free software. If
your company depends on ImageMagick, sponsoring ImageMagick development
is a way to express your gratitude and to contribute back to the development
ImageMagick.
<p>ImageMagick sponsorship can take many forms. The following are some
possibilities:
<ul>
<li>
Provide assistance with legal matters related to ImageMagick Studio.</li>

<li>
Support a high-bandwidth public ftp site to serve as the main distribution
point for ImageMagick.</li>

<li>
Provide technical writers to assist with the development of commercial-grade
technical documentation.</li>

<li>
Provide professional artists and web-site developers to help improve the
ImageMagick web site.</li>

<li>
Donate needed hardware and software in order help us develop a better product.</li>

<li>
Donate source code to help improve ImageMagick where it is currently weak
(such as support for ICC color profiles, or a GUI for a specific operating
system).</li>

<li>
Produce ImageMagick CD-ROMs for distribution.</li>

<li>
Supply T-shirts, plush-toys, base-ball caps, and other collectibles to
help promote ImageMagick.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Sponsorship may be anonymous, or public. We are willing to provide recognition
for significant sponsorships, and can provide links to the sponsor's web
site.  For direct monetary contributions, send a check or money order in
US funds to
