UNIX/Cygwin COMPILATION

  Note:

    Platform specific notes regarding specific operating systems may be
    found in the PLATFORMS.txt file. This file (README.txt) provides
    generic instructions which work in most common cases.

  Type:

    gzip -dc ImageMagick-5.4.6.tar.gz | tar xvf -
    cd ImageMagick-5.4.6

  If you do not have gunzip(1), it is available as
  ftp.gnu.org:pub/gnu/gzip-1.2.4.shar.

  Use 'configure' to automatically configure, build, and install
  ImageMagick.

  If you are willing to accept configure's default options, type:

      ./configure

  and watch the configure script output to verify that it finds
  everything that you think it should. If it does not, then adjust your
  environment so that it does.

  If you are not happy with configure's choice of compiler, compilation
  flags, or libraries, you can give `configure' initial values for
  variables by specifying them on the configure command line, e.g.:

      ./configure CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix

  The configure variables you should be aware of are:

      CC          Name of C compiler (e.g. 'cc -Xa') to use
      CXX         Name of C++ compiler to use (e.g. 'CC')
      CFLAGS      Compiler flags (e.g. '-g -O2') to compile C code
      CXXFLAGS    Compiler flags (e.g. '-g -O2') to compile C++ code
      CPPFLAGS    Include paths (-I/somedir) to look for header files
      LDFLAGS     Library paths (-L/somedir) to look for libraries
                  Systems that support the notion of a library run-path may
                  require an additional argument in order to find shared
                  libraries at run time. For example, the Solaris linker
                  requires an argument of the form '-R/somedir', some Linux
                  systems will work with '-rpath /somedir', while some other
                  Linux systems who's gcc does not pass -rpath to the linker
                  require an argument of the form '-Wl,-rpath,/somedir'.
      LIBS        Extra libraries (-lsomelib) required to link

  Any variable (e.g. CPPFLAGS or LDFLAGS) which requires a directory
  path must specify an absolute path rather than a relative path.

  By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
  `/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an
  installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `configure' the
  option `--prefix=PATH'.

  Configure can usually find the X include and library files
  automatically, but if it doesn't, you can use the `configure' options
  `--x-includes=DIR' and `--x-libraries=DIR' to specify their
  locations.

  The configure script provides a number of ImageMagick specific
  options.  When disabling an option --disable-something is equivalent
  to specifying --enable-something=no and --without-something is
  equivalent to --with-something=no.  The configure options are as
  follows (execute 'configure --help' to see all options).

  Optional Features:
   --enable-prof           enable 'prof' profiling support (default disabled)
   --enable-gprof          enable 'gprof' profiling support (default disabled)
   --enable-gcov           enable 'gcov' profiling support (default disabled)
   --disable-largefile     disable support for large (64 bit) file offsets
   --enable-lzw            enable LZW support (default disabled)
   --disable-16bit-pixel   disable 16 bit/quantum pixels (default enabled)

  Optional Packages:
   --with-modules          enable support for dynamically loadable modules
   --with-cache            set pixel cache threshhold (defaults to available memory)
   --without-threads       disable threads support
   --without-frozenpaths   disable frozen delegate paths
   --without-magick-plus-plus disable build/install of Magick++
   --without-perl          disable build/install of PerlMagick
        or
   --with-perl=PERL        use specified Perl binary to configure PerlMagick
   --with-perl-options=OPTIONS  options to pass on command-line when
                           generating PerlMagick's Makefile from Makefile.PL
   --without-bzlib         disable BZLIB support
   --without-dps           disable Display Postscript support
   --without-fpx           disable FlashPIX support
   --without-gslib         disable Ghostscript library support
   --with-hdf              enable HDF support
   --without-jbig          disable JBIG support
   --without-jpeg          disable JPEG support
   --without-jp2           disable JPEG v2 support
   --without-lcms          disable LCMS support
   --without-mpeg2         disable MPEG support
   --without-png           disable PNG support
   --without-tiff          disable TIFF support
   --without-ttf           disable TrueType support
   --without-wmf           disable WMF support
   --with-fontpath         prepend to default font search path
   --with-gs-font-dir      directory containing Ghostscript fonts
   --with-windows-font-dir directory containing MS-Windows fonts
   --without-xml           disable XML support
   --without-zlib          disable ZLIB support
   --with-x                use the X Window System
   --with-share-path=DIR   Alternate path to share directory
                           (default share/ImageMagick)
   --with-libstdc=DIR      use libstdc++ in DIR (for GNU C++)

  ImageMagick options represent either features to be enabled,
  disabled, or packages to be included in the build.  When a feature is
  enabled (via --enable-something), it enables code already present in
  ImageMagick.  When a package is enabled (via --with-something), the
  configure script will search for it, and if is is properly installed
  and ready to use (headers and built libraries are found by compiler)
  it will be included in the build.  The configure script is delivered
  with all features disabled and all packages enabled. In general, the
  only reason to disable a package is if a package exists but it is
  unsuitable for the build (perhaps an old version or not compiled with
  the right compilation flags).

  Several configure options require special note:

    o --enable-shared: the shared libraries are built. Shared
      libraries are preferred because they allow programs to share
      common code, making the individual programs much smaller. In
      addition shared libraries are required in order for PerlMagick
      to be dynamically loaded by an installed PERL (otherwise an
      additional PERL (PerlMagick) must be installed.  This option
      is not the default because it is usually the case that all
      libraries used by ImageMagick also be dynamic libraries if
      ImageMagick itself is to be dynamically loaded (such as for
      PerlMagick).

      ImageMagick built with delegates (see MAGICK PLUG-INS below) can
      pose additional challenges.  You can build all the delegates
      statically and link them into the ImageMagick shared library
      (i.e. libMagick.so) or alternatively you can build the delegates
      as shared libraries (some systems already have delegates
      installed as shared libraries).  Shared libraries compilation
      flags differ from vendor to vendor (gcc's is -fPIC).  However,
      you must compile all shared library source with the same flag
      (for gcc use -fPIC rather than -fpic).  Accomplishing this
      often requires hand-editing Makefiles.

      If --enable-shared is not specified, a new PERL interpreter
      (PerlMagick) is built which is statically linked against the
      PerlMagick extension. This new interpreter is installed into the
      same directory as the ImageMagick utilities. If --enable-shared is
      specified, the PerlMagick extension is built as a dynamically
      loadable object which is loaded into your current PERL interpreter
      at run-time. Use of dynamically-loaded extensions is preferable
      over statically linked extensions so --enable-shared should be
      specified if possible.

    o --disable-static: static archive libraries (with extension .a)
      are not built.  If you are building shared libraries, there is
      little value to building static libraries. Reasons to build
      static libraries include: 1) they can be easier to debug; 2) the
      clients do not have external dependencies (i.e. libMagick.so); 3)
      building PIC versions of the delegate libraries may take
      additional expertise and effort; 4) you are unable to build
      shared libraries.

    o --with-modules: image format coders are built as loadable modules
      which are installed in [prefix]/lib/ImageMagick/modules/coders.
      Support for modules allows the formats supported by ImageMagick
      to be extended by simply adding additional modules to the module
      search path.  The modules option is only available in conjunction
      with --enable-shared.  If --enable-shared is not also specified,
      then support for modules is disabled.

    o --enable-lzw: Unisys reportedly claims a patent on the algorithm
      supporting LZW compression (e.g. used by GIF and TIFF).  To avoid
      possibly infringing on this patent, support for LZW is disabled
      by default.  With LZW support, GIF files written by ImageMagick
      will be much larger than expected.

    o --disable-16bit-pixel: By default ImageMagick represents images
      internally using a sixteen-bit pixel quantum (the size of the red,
      green, blue, and alpha pixel components). The definition
      QuantumDepth=8 is applied when ImageMagick is built, allowing RGBA
      values to range from 0 to 255 rather than 0 to 65535. Use of
      sixteen-bit pixel quantums typically causes ImageMagick to run
      about 30% slower then when it is built to support eight-bit pixel
      quantums. Those who favor performance over output quality may
      prefer to specify --disable-16bit-pixel.
      
    o --without-magick-plus-plus: Disable building Magick++, the C++
      application programming interface to ImageMagick.  A suitable C++
      compiler is required. Specify the CXX configure variable to
      select the C++ compiler to use (default "g++"), and CXXFLAGS to
      select the desired compiler opimization and debug flags
      (default "-g -O2").

    o --without-frozenpaths: By default, the configure script will
      determine the location of all delegates (external programs) and
      incorporate the full paths within the delegates.mgk file. This is
      the default because it is assumed that the installer's
      environment is appropriately configured and that the operation of
      ImageMagick should not be subject to the end-user's environment.
      However, if it is desirable to allow the end user to define
      their own environment or possible that the end user's environment
      does not match the installer's environment (e.g. for binary
      distributions), --without-frozenpaths may be specified so that
      only the delegate's name is included in the delegates.mgk file.

    o --without-threads: By default, the ImageMagick library is compiled
      with multi-thread support.  If this is undesireable, then specify
      --without-threads.

    o --with-cache: Specify a different image pixel cache threshold
      using the --with-cache option. When ImageMagick will have more
      image pixel data in memory than the cache threshold setting,
      additional images are cached on disk. Since memory is much faster
      than disk, it is usually better to use memory rather than disk
      for the pixel cache. The default cache threshold is 2047MB.
      Small memory machines may want to decrease the threshold.

    o --disable-largefile: By default, ImageMagick is compiled with
      support for large (> 2GB on a 32-bit CPU) files if the operating
      system supports large files.  All applications which use the
      ImageMagick library must then also include support for large
      files. By disabling support for large files via
      --disable-largefile, dependent applications do not require
      special compilation options for large files in order to use the
      library.

    o --without-perl: By default, PerlMagick is conveniently compiled
      and installed as part of ImageMagick's normal "configure", "make",
      "make install" process.. When --without-perl is specified, you must
      first install ImageMagick, change to the PerlMagick subdirectory,
      build, and finally install PerlMagick. Note, PerlMagick is configured
      even if --without-perl is specified. If the argument
      --with-perl=/path/to/perl is supplied, then /path/to/perl will be
      taken as the PERL interpreter to use. This is important in case
      the 'perl' executable in your PATH is not PERL5, or is not the
      PERL you want to use.

    o --with-perl-options: The PerlMagick module is normally installed
      using the Perl interpreter's installation PREFIX, rather than
      ImageMagick's. If ImageMagick's installation prefix is not the
      same as PERL's PREFIX, then you may find that PerlMagick's 'make
      install' step tries to install into a directory tree that you
      don't have write permissions to. This is common when PERL is
      delivered with the operating system or on Internet Service
      Provider (ISP) web servers. If you want PerlMagick to install
      elsewhere, then provide a PREFIX option to PERL's configuration
      step via "--with-perl-options=PREFIX=/some/place". Other options
      accepted by MakeMaker are 'LIB', 'LIBPERL_A', 'LINKTYPE', and
      'OPTIMIZE'. See the ExtUtils::MakeMaker(3) manual page for more
      information on configuring PERL extensions.

    o --without-x: By default, ImageMagick will use X11 libraries if
      they are available. When --without-x is specified, use of X11 is
      disabled. The display, animate, and import programs are not built
      or installed. The remaining programs have reduced functionality
      such as no access to X11 fonts (consider using Postscript or
      TrueType fonts instead).

    o --with-gs-font-dir: Specify the directory containing the
      Ghostscript Postscript Type 1 font files (e.g. "n022003l.pfb") so
      that they can be rendered using the FreeType library. If the font
      files are installed using the default Ghostscript installation
      paths (prefix/share/ghostscript/fonts), they should be discovered
      automatically by configure and specifying this option is not
      necessary. Specify this option if the Ghostscript fonts fail to be
      located automatically, or the location needs to be overridden.

    o --with-windows-font-dir: If configured under a Unix emulation
      environment like Cygwin or mingw, configure should automatically
      locate the MS-Windows system font directory. If configure is not
      running under MS-Windows yet MS-Windows-compatible fonts are
      available use --with-windows-font-dir=/path to specify the
      directory where the fonts are installed.

  Building under Cygwin

    ImageMagick may be built under the Windows '95-XP Cygwin (version
    1.3.9 or later) Unix-emulation environment available from
    "http://www.cygwin.com/". X11R6 for Cygwin is available from
    "http://xfree86.cygwin.com/". It is strongly recommended that the
    X11R6 package be installed since this enables ImageMagick's X11
    support (animate, display, and import will work) and it includes the
    Freetype v2 DLL required to support TrueType and Postscript Type 1
    fonts. Make sure that /usr/X11R6/bin is in your PATH prior to
    running configure. If the configure options '--enable-shared' or
    '--enable-shared --with-modules' are specified , then the
    'auto-import' capability of binutils and libtool is used to build
    DLLs. ImageMagick DLL support under Cygwin should be considered
    experimental at this time.

  Dealing with configuration failures:

    While configure is designed to ease installation of ImageMagick, it
    often discovers problems that would otherwise be encountered later
    when compiling ImageMagick. The configure script tests for headers
    and libraries by executing the compiler (CC) with the specified
    compilation flags (CFLAGS), pre-processor flags (CPPFLAGS), and
    linker flags (LDFLAGS). Any errors are logged to the file
    'config.log'. If configure fails to discover a header or library
    please review this log file to determine why, however, please be
    aware that *errors in the config.log are normal* because configure
    works by trying something and seeing if it fails. An error in
    config.log is only a problem if the test should have worked on your
    system.. After taking corrective action, be sure to remove the
    'config.cache' file before running configure so that configure will
    re-inspect the environment rather than using cached values.

    Common causes of configure failures are: 1) a delegate header is not
    in the header include path (CPPFLAGS -I option); 2) a delegate
    library is not in the linker search/run path (LDFLAGS -L/-R
    option); 3) a delegate library is missing a function (old
    version?); 4) compilation environment is faulty.

    If all reasonable corrective actions have been tried and the
    problem appears to be due to a flaw in the configure script, please
    send a bug report to the configure script maintainer (currently
    bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us). All bug reports should contain the
    operating system type (as reported by 'uname -a') and the
    compiler/compiler-version. A copy of the configure script output
    and/or the config.log file may be valuable in order to find the
    problem. If you send a config.log, please also send a script of the
    configure output and a description of what you expected to see (and
    why) so the failure you are observing can be identified and
    resolved.

  Compilation:

    Now that ImageMagick is configured, type

       make

    to build the package.

  Verifying The Build:

    To confirm your build of the ImageMagick distribution was successful,
    type:
  
        ./utilities/display

    The ImageMagick logo is displayed.
  
    If the image colors are not correct use this command:
  
        ./utilities/display -visual default
  
    For a more serious test, you may run the ImageMagick test suite by
    typing
  
        make check

    Note that due to differences between the developer's environment and
    your own it is possible that some tests may be indicated as failed
    even though the results are ok. Differences between the developer's
    environment environment and your own may include the compiler, the
    CPU type, and the library versions used. The ImageMagick developers
    use the current release of all dependent libraries.

  Documentation:

    Be sure to read the manual pages for the display(1), animate(1),
    montage(1), import(1), mogrify(1), identify(1), composite(1), and
    convert(1) utilities. Also read the ImageMagick frequently asked
    questions in the file www/Magick.html. This is required reading.
    Most of the questions I get via electronic mail are answered in this
    document.

  X11 Resources:

    Place display(1) X application defaults in
    /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Display. Use the appropriate name for
    other clients (e.g. Animate, Montage, etc). To execute display(1)
    from as a menu item of any window manager (olwm, mwm, twm, etc), use

       logo:Untitled

MAGICK DELEGATES

  To further enhance the capabilities of ImageMagick, you may want to
  get these programs or libraries:

    o ImageMagick requires the BZLIB library from

          http://sourceware.cygnus.com/bzip2/index.html

      to read and write BZip compressed MIFF images.

    o ImageMagick requires ralcgm from

          http://www.agocg.ac.uk/train/cgm/ralcgm.htm

      to read the Computer Graphics Metafile image format (may not
      compile under linux).  You also need Ghostscript (see below).

    o ImageMagick requires fig2dev from

          ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/applications/drawing_tools/transfig

      to read the TransFig image format.

    o ImageMagick requires the FreeType software, version 2.0 or above,
      available as

         http://www.freetype.org/

      to annotate with TrueType fonts.

    o ImageMagick requires Ghostscript software available from

         http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/

      to read the Postscript or the Portable Document format.  It is
      used to annotate an image when an X server is not available.  See
      the FreeType library above for another means to annotate an
      image.  Note, Ghostscript must support the ppmraw device (type gs
      -h to verify).  If Ghostscript is unavailable, the Display
      Postscript extension is used to rasterize a Postscript document
      (assuming you define HasDPS).  The DPS extension is less robust
      than Ghostscript in that it will only rasterize one page of a
      multi-page document.

      Ghostscript (released 7.0 and later) may optionally install a
      library (libgs). If this library is installed, ImageMagick will
      attempt to use it unless the option --without-gslib is passed to
      configure. Note that Ghostscript provides its own modified version
      of libjpeg and that symbols from this libjpeg may be confused with
      symbols with the stand-alone libjpeg. If conflicts cause JPEG to
      fail, it may be necessary to use Ghostscript's copy of libjpeg for
      ImageMagick, and all delegate libraries which depend on libjpeg..

    o ImageMagick requires the NCSA HDF5 library available via anonymous
      FTP as

          ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF/HDF/HDF_Current

      to read and write the HDF image format.  By default HDF support is
      disabled because HDF5 is not yet complete.

    o ImageMagick requires hp2xx available from

          http://www.gnu.org/software/hp2xx/hp2xx.html

      to read the HP-GL image format.

    o ImageMagick requires the LCMS library available from

          http://www.littlecms.com

      to perform color management.

    o ImageMagick requires gnuplot available via anonymous FTP as

          ftp://ftp.dartmouth.edu/pub/gnuplot/gnuplot3.5.tar.Z

      to read GNUPLOT plot files (with extension gplt).

    o ImageMagick requires html2ps available from

          http://www.tdb.uu.se/~jan/html2ps.html

      to read the HTML image format.

    o ImageMagick requires the JBIG-Kit software available via
      anonymous FTP as

          ftp://ftp.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/pub/doc/ISO/JBIG/

      to read the JBIG image format.

    o ImageMagick requires the Independent JPEG Group's software
      available via anonymous FTP as

          ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz

      to read the JPEG image format.

      Apply this JPEG patch to Independent JPEG Group's source
      distribution to read lossless jpeg-encoded DICOM images:

          ftp://ftp.imagemagick.org/pub/ImageMagick/delegates/
            ljpeg-6b.tar.gz

      Concerning iterative JPEG compression:  see Kinoshita and
      Yamamuro, Journal of Imaging Science and Technology, "Image
      Quality with Reiterative JPEG Compression", Volume 39, Number 4,
      July 1995, 306-312 who claim that (1) the iterative factor of the
      repetitive JPEG operation had no influence on image quality, and
      (2) the first compression determined base image quality.

    o ImageMagick requires the MPEG utilities from the MPEG Software
      Simulation Group, which are available via anonymous FTP as

          ftp://ftp.mpeg.org/pub/mpeg/mssg/mpeg2vidcodec_v12.tar.gz

      to read or write the MPEG image format.

    o ImageMagick requires the PNG library, version 1.0 or above, from

          http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/pngcode.html

      to read the PNG image format.

    o ImageMagick requires ra_ppm from Greg Ward's Radiance
      software available via anonymous FTP as

          http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/HOME.html

      to read the Radiance image format (may not compile under linux).

    o ImageMagick requires rawtorle from the Utah Raster Toolkit
      available via anonymous FTP as

          ftp://ftp.cs.utah.edu/pub/dept/OLD/pub/urt-3.1b.tar.Z

      to write the RLE image format (may not compile under linux).

    o ImageMagick requires scanimage from

          http://www.mostang.com/sane/

      to import image from a scanner device.

    o ImageMagick requires Sam Leffler's TIFF software available
      via anonymous FTP at

          ftp://ftp.remotesensing.org/pub/libtiff/

      or via HTTP at

          http://www.libtiff.org/

      to read the TIFF image format.  It in turn optionally requires
      the JPEG and ZLIB libraries.  The TIFF library no longer includes
      support for LZW compression due to patent issues.  If you need to
      use LZW compression, support is available via a seperate
      LZW compression kit (a patch) at the sites listed above.

    o ImageMagick requires libwmf 0.2.2 (or CVS libwmf) available
      from

          http://sourceforge.net/projects/wvware/

      to read the Windows Meta File image format (16-bit WMF files only,
      not 32-bit "EMF") under Unix. This is the format commonly used for
      Windows clipart (available on CD at your local computer or
      technical book store). WMF support also requires the FreeType
      library.

      If ImageMagick is built using libwmf then WMF files are rendered
      via ImageMagick's wmf coder module, otherwise output of the
      wmf2magick program is rendered by ImageMagick. The configure
      script for libwmf offers a choice between using the 'expat' XML
      library (--with-expat) and xmlsoft's libxml (--with-xml). Since
      ImageMagick already uses libxml (for reading SVG), it is
      recommended that the options '--without-expat --with-xml' be
      supplied to libwmf's configure script.

      ImageMagick's WMF renderer provides some of the finest WMF
      rendering available due its use of antialiased drawing algorithms.
      You may select a background color or texture image to render on.
      For example, "-background '#ffffffff'" renders on a transparent
      background while "-texture plasma:fractal" renders on a fractal
      image.

      A set of Windows 3.1 compatible TrueType fonts (Arial, Times New
      Roman, and Courier New) may be downloaded without charge from
      Microsoft's web site via the URL

        http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fontpack/default.htm

      The libwmf-based WMF renderer is not capable of using Windows
      fonts with libwmf 0.2.2.  Windows fonts are fully supported
      when the CVS (development) version of libwmf is used.

    o ImageMagick requires the FlashPIX library version 1.2.0 from
      the Digital Imaging Group in order to support the FlashPIX
      format. The FlashPIX library may be obtained from ImageMagick
      anonymous CVS by checking out the 'fpx' module, or retrieving
      the file libfpx-1.2.0.4.tar.gz from the ftp directory

        ftp://ftp.imagemagick.org/pub/ImageMagick/delegates/.

    o ImageMagick requires an X server for display and animate to work
      properly.  There is a nearly free X server available for Windows
      and Macintosh at

          http://www.microimages.com/freestuf/mix/

    o ImageMagick requires libxml available from

          http://xmlsoft.org/

      to read the SVG image format.

    o ImageMagick requires the ZLIB library from

          http://ftp.freesoftware.com/pub/infozip/zlib/

      to read or write the PNG or Zip compressed MIFF images.

    o ImageMagick requires a background texture for the TILE
      format and for the -texture option of montage(1).  You can use
      your own or get samples from

          http://the-tech.mit.edu/KPT/

  as well as the VMS versions of the JPEG, PNG, TTF, and TIFF
  libraries.


Windows Win2K/95 VISUAL C++ 6.0 COMPILATION

  The Visual C++ distribution targeted at Windows Win2K or Windows 95
  does not provide any stock workspace (DSW) or project files (DSP)
  except for those included with third party libraries. Instead, there
  is a "configure" program that must be built and run that creates an
  environment that meets your particular needs.

  The issue with the Visual C++ working environment is that there are
  a fairly large number of mutually exclusive options that must all be
  used in a coherent manner, or problems result.

  The Visual C++ system provides three different types of "runtimes"
  that must match across all application, library, and DLL code that is
  built. The "configure" program creates a set of build files that are
  consistent for a specific runtime selection.

  The three options for runtime support are:

    1) Dynamic Multi-threaded DLL runtimes.
    2) Static Single-threaded runtimes
    3) Static Multi-threaded runtimes
    4) Static Multi-threaded DLL runtimes

  In addition to these runtimes, the VisualMagick build environment
  allows you to select whether to include the X11 libraries in the
  build or use the X11 "stubs". The assumption is that most Win32 user
  could care less about X11 support, so we stub out all the X11
  functionality so that everything compiles. However, the X11 utility
  programs animate, display, and import will not work.

  This leads to five different possible build options, which should
  cover almost any particular situation. The default binary
  distribution is built using #1 from above with the X11 libraries
  included. This results in an X11 compatible build using all DLL's for
  everything and multi-threaded support (the only option for DLL's).

  To do a build for your requirements, simply go to the configure sub-
  directory under VisualMagick and open the configure.dsw workspace.
  Set the build configuration to "Release" under the

      "Build..., Set Active Configuration..."  menu.

  Build and execute the configure program and follow the instructions.
  You should probably not change any of the defaults unless you have a
  specific reason to do so.

  After creating your build environment you can proceed to open the DSW
  file that was generated and build everything from there.

  In the final DSW file you will find a project call "All". In order to
  build everything in the distribution, select this project and make it
  the "active" project. Set the build configuration to the desired one
  (Debug, or Release) and do a "clean" followed by a "build". You
  should do the build in a specific way:

    1) Make the "All" project the active project (Bold)
       Right click on the All project and select "Set As Active
       Project"
    2) Select "Build..., Clean"
    3) Select "Build..., Build"
    4) Go get some coffee unless you have a very fast machine!.

  The "Clean" step is needed in order to make sure that all of the
  target support libraries are updated with any patches needed to get
  them to compile properly under Visual C++.

  All of the required files that are needed to run any of the command
  line tools will be found in the "bin" subdirectory of the
  VisualMagick subdirectory. This includes EXE, and DLL files. You
  should be able to test the build directly from this directory without
  having to move anything to any of the global SYSTEM or SYSTEM32 areas
  in the operating system installation.

  NOTE #1:

  The Visual C++ distribution of ImageMagick comes with the Magick++
  C++ wrapper by default. This add-on layer has a large number of demo
  and test files that can be found in ImageMagick\Magick++\demo, and
  ImageMagick\Magick++\tests. There are also a variety of tests that
  use the straight C API as well in ImageMagick\tests.

  All of these programs are NOT configured to be built in the default
  workspace created by the configure program. You can cause all of
  these demos and test programs to be built by checking the box in
  configure that says:

    "Include all demo and test programs"

  In addition, there is another related checkbox (checked by default)
  that causes all generate project files to be created standalone so
  that they can be copied to other areas of you system.

  This is the checkbox:

   "Generate all utility projects with full paths rather then relative
    paths"

  WOW - that a mouthfull - eh?

  The problem is that Visual C++ uses a concept of "dependencies" that
  tell it what other things need to be build when a particular project
  is being build. This mechanism is also used to cause things to link
  properly. In my normal development environment, I want to be able to
  make changes and debug the system as a whole, so I like and NEED to
  use dependencies. However, most end users don't want to work this
  way.

  Instead they really just want to build the package and then get down
  to business working on their application. The solution is to make all
  the utility projects (UTIL_xxxx_yy_exe.dsp) use full absolute paths
  to all the things they need. This way the projects stand on their own
  and can actually be copied and used as templates to get a particular
  custom application compiling with little effort.

  With this feature enabled, you should be able to nab a copy of...
    
    VisualMagick\utilities\UTIL_convert_xxx_exe.dsp  (for C)

     -or-

    VisualMagick\Magick++\demo\UTIL_demo_xxx_exe.dsp (for C++)

  ... and pop it into notepad, modify it (carefully) to your needs and
  be on your way to happy compiling and linking. 

  You can feel free to pick any of the standard utilities, tests, or
  demo programs as the basis for a new program by copying the project
  and the source and hacking away.

  The choice of what to use as a starting point is very easy...

  For straight C API command line applications use something from:

    ImageMagick\tests or ImageMagick\utilities (source code)
    ImageMagick\VisualMagick\tests or ImageMagick\Visualmagick\utilities
      (project - DSP)

  For C++ and Magick++ command line applications use something from:

    ImageMagick\Magick++\tests or ImageMagick\Magick++\demo
      (source code)
    ImageMagick\VisualMagick\Magick++\tests or
      ImageMagick\VisualMagick\Magick++\demo (project - DSP)

  For C++ and Magick++ and MFC windows applications use:
   
    ImageMagick\contrib\win32\MFC\NtMagick (source code)
    ImageMagick\VisualMagick\contrib\win32\MFC\NtMagick
      (project - DSP)

  NOTE #2:

  The 5.2.x distribution is much more modular then any previous release
  of ImageMagick. The default configuration is there to get you
  rolling, but you need to make some serious choices when you wish to
  change things around.

  The binary distribution and default options are all targeted at
  having all the components in one place - the "bin" directory of the
  VisualMagick build tree AND the C:\ImageMagick folder.

  The C:\ImageMagick folder should contain the following files:

      1) magic.mgk
      2) delegates.mgk (derived from nt.mgk)
      3) modules.mgk
      4) rgb.txt

  The "bin" folder should contains all EXE's and DLL's as well as the
  very important "modules.mgk" file.

  With this default setup, you can use any of the command line tools
  and run scripts as normal. You can actually get by quite nicely this
  way by doing something like "pushd e:\xxx\yyy\bin" in any scripts you
  write to execute "out of" this directory.

  ALSO, By default the core of ImageMagick on Win32 always looks in the
  place were the exe program is run from in order to find all of the
  files as well as the DLL's it needs.

  Of course - all of this is configurable and there are certain
  environment variables and compiler switches that allow you to do
  whatever you want. Some of these are Windows things and the rest are
  looked at by the core ImageMagick code.

  ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:

  You can use the "System" control panel to allow you to add and delete
  what is in any of the environment variables. You can even
  have user specific environment variables if you wish.

  PATH

   This sets the default list of places were Windows looks for EXE's
   and DLL's. Windows CMD shell seems to look in the "current"
   directory first - no matter what, so that is why you really don't
   have to muck. If you wish to run any of utilities from another
   location then you must add the path to your "bin" directory in. For
   instance, you might add:

      D:\CVS\ImageMagick\VisualMagick\bin

   to do this for the default build environment like I do.  One slight
   problem with this is that fact that Windows has another program
   called "convert". I usually rename this to something else since it
   is only used to convert disks from FAT to NTFS.

  MAGICK_HOME

   If all you do is modify the PATH variable, the first problem you
   will run into is that ImageMagick may not be able to find any of its
   "modules. We did not have modules until 5.2 so this is a NEW
   problems. Modules are all the IM_MOD*.DLL files you see in the
   distribution. There is one of these for each and every file format
   that ImageMagick supports. This environment variable tells the
   system were to look for these DLL's. The compiled in "default" is
   "execution path" - which says - look in the same place that the
   application is running "in". If you are running from somewhere other
   then "bin" - this will no longer work and you must use this
   variable. If you elect to leave the modules in the same place as the
   EXE's (a good idea) then you can simply set this to the same place
   as you did the PATH variable. In my case:

      D:\\ImageMagick\coders

   This is also the place were ImageMagick expects to find the all
   important "modules.mgk" file.

   One cool thing about 5.2 is that you can now leave out file formats
   and lighten you load. If all you ever need is GIF and JPEG, then
   simply drop all the other DLL's into the local trash can and get on
   with your life.

   WARNING: Always keep the "xc" format, since IM seems to need and
   "assume" that this one exists and gets real "unhappy" if it does
   not. We are still tracking down some of these issues.

  ALSO. You can elect to changes these things the good old "hard-
  coded" way. Two #defines are applicable.

  defines.h has 

      #define MagickConfigurePath  "c:\\ImageMagick\\"

  NOTE #3:

  The two utilities "display" and "animate" will only be usable when
  the real X11 libraries are included. The other build environments
  uses the X11 stubs to supply non-functional stubs for the X-Window
  functionality. There is no support for a "static" build of the X11
  support because the build procedures for the X11 libraries do not
  seem to support this.

  To view any image in a Microsoft window, type

      convert image.ext win:

  Make sure gswin32 (Ghostscript) is in your execution path (see
  Autoexec.bat), otherwise, you will be unable to convert or view a
  Postscript document.

  Make sure iexplore (Internet Explorer) is in your execution path (see
  Autoexec.bat), otherwise, you will be unable to browse the
  ImageMagick documentation.

  The Win2K executables will work under Windows 95/98.


MACINTOSH COMPILATION

  The Macintosh distribution contains MetroWerks Codewarrior
  Professional projects for compilation.  For those who do not have
  access to CodeWarrior, the binaries for the command line utilities
  are enclosed.  I had to comment the inline intrinsic functions in
  math.h in order to compile.  If you have a better solution, let me
  know.

  Display(1), animate(1), and import(1) currently do not work on the
  Macintosh.


Magick++

  Magick++ provides a straightforward C++ language API to ImageMagick.
  Magick++ is built by default under the Unix, Windows, and Mac build
  environments. To disable building Magick++ under Unix, specify
  --without-magick-plus-plus as an argument to the configure script.

  Magick++ is currently supported using the following C++ compilers:

    egcs 1.1.2 (or later)
    gcc 2.95.2 (or later)
    Visual C++ 6.0 (Windows)
    IRIX C++ 7.3.1.1m
    Sun Workshop 5.0 C++ (tests/demos require work-around to build)
    Sun Forte 6.0 C++
    CodeWarrior Professional Release 5 (Macintosh)

  and may compile under other modern C++ compilers as well.
