Welcome to GraphicsMagick.

GraphicsMagick provides a comprehensive collection of utilities,
programming interfaces, and GUIs, to support image processing and 2D
vector rendering.

GraphicsMagick is originally based on ImageMagick from ImageMagick
Studio (which was originally written at Dupont). The goal of Open
ImageMagick is to provide the highest quality product possible while
encouraging open and active participation from all interested
developers. The GraphicsMagick usage license is designed to allow it
to be used for any application, including proprietary or GPLed
applications.
