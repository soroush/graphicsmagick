JBIG-KIT revision history
-------------------------

Changes in version 1.4 (2002-04-09)

  - typo fixed in stripe number calculation, which caused encoder and
    decoder to fail on certain image sizes (special thanks to Koen Denecker
    <denecker@elis.rug.ac.be> for locating this one)

Changes in version 1.3 (2002-03-23):

  - bugs fixed in jbg_split_planes(), jbg_dec_merge_planes() that
    caused a failure for more than eight planes per pixel

  - example converters now can handle PGM files with up to 32 bits
    per pixel

Changes in version 1.2 (2000-04-08):

  - bug in the decoder fixed, which caused the rest of the input file
    to be skipped whenever a comment marker was encountered (special
    thanks to Ben Rudiak-Gould <benrg@math.berkeley.edu> for
    reporting this one)

Changes in version 1.1 (1999-11-16):

  - serious bug in the encoder fixed, which for a very small
    percentage of images has caused an unterminated linked list to be
    created internally that could have been responsible for
    segmentation violations or non-terminating encoders
    (special thanks to Hisashi Saiga <saiga@itl.tnr.sharp.co.jp> for
    tracking that one down)

  - minor bug in the "jbgtopbm -d" diagnostic output fixed

Changes in version 1.0 (1998-04-11):

  - two bugs fixed that caused the encoder and decoder to fail
    under certain modes of operation with several bit planes

  - added new functions jbg_split_planes(), jbg_dec_merge_planes(),
    and jbg_dec_getsize_merged() for easy handling of grayscale
    images

  - added support for compressing grayscale PGM files to pbmtojbg
    and jbgtopbm

  - more changes to avoid paranoid compiler warnings

Changes in version 0.9 (1996-01-09):

  - encoder won't break any more on input bitmap data with incorrect
    zero padding

  - pbmtojbg displays a warning if input file has incorrect zero
    padding

  - various minor improvements suggested by Stefan Willer
    <Stefan.Willer@unnet.wupper.DE>

  - many minor changes in order to avoid warnings from paranoid
    compilers

Changes in version 0.8 (1995-09-20):

  - namespace cleared up, all names externally visible from the library
    start now with jbg_ or JBG_

  - minor non-critical bug fixed which caused library to fail compatibility
    test and showed up especially on DEC Alpha systems

  - jbg_dec_gethight() is now called jbg_dec_getheight()

  - filenames conform now to MS-DOS limits

  - Bug in pbmtojbg fixed (handling of ASCII PBM files)

Changes in version 0.7 (1995-06-10):

  - more problems on 16-bit int systems and on Macintosh systems fixed
    (special thanks to Jean-Pierre Gachen <jpg11@calvanet.calvacom.fr>)

  - global Makefile

Changes in version 0.6 (1995-06-08):

  - memory leak fixed

  - should now also work on systems where int is only 16-bit large

  - changes of the JBIG "Technical Corrigendum 1" included (special
    thanks to Dr. Sebestyen from Siemens AG for sending me a copy
    of the draft)

First release: version 0.5 (1995-05-28)
