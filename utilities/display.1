.SH EXAMPLES

To scale an image of a cockatoo to exactly 640 pixels in width and 480
pixels in height and position the window at location (200,200), use:

    display -geometry 640x480+200+200! cockatoo.miff

To display an image of a cockatoo without a border centered on a backdrop,
use:

    display +borderwidth -backdrop cockatoo.miff

To tile a slate texture onto the root window, use:

    display -size 1280x1024 -window root slate.png

To display a visual image directory of all your JPEG images, use:

    display 'vid:*.jpg'

To display a MAP image that is 640 pixels in width and 480 pixels in height
with 256 colors, use:

    display -size 640x480+256 cockatoo.map

To display an image of a cockatoo specified with a \fBWorld Wide Web (WWW)\fP
uniform resource locator \fB(URL)\fP, use:

    display ftp://wizards.dupont.com/images/cockatoo.jpg

To display histogram of an image, use:

    convert file.jpg HISTOGRAM:- | display -
.SH OPTIONS

Options are processed in command line order. Any option you specify on
the command line remains in effect until it is explicitly changed by specifying
the option again with a different effect. For example to display three images,
the first with 32 colors, the second with an unlimited number of colors,
and the third with only 16 colors, use:

      display -colors 32 cockatoo.miff -noop duck.miff
              -colors 16 macaw.miff

\fBDisplay\fP options can appear on the command line or in your X resources
file. See \fIX(1)\fP. Options on the command line supersede values specified
in your X resources file.

The keyboard accelerators that
\fBdisplay\fP understands is:

    Ctl+O     Press to load an image from a file.
    space     Press to display the next image.

If the image is a multi-paged document such as a
\fIPostScript\fP document,
you can skip ahead several pages by preceding this command with a number.
For example to display the fourth page beyond the current page,
press 4space.

    backspace Press to display the former image.

If the image is a multi-paged document such as a

    Cmd-A    Press to make any image transformations permanent.
             By default, any image size transformations are
             applied to the original image to create the image
             displayed on the X server.  However, the
             transformations are not permanent (i.e. the original
             image does not change size only the X image does).
             For example, if you press ">" the X image will
             appear to double in size, but the original image
             will in fact remain the same size.  To force the
             original image to double in size, press ">" followed

Here the matte information is ignored.

The image compositor requires a matte, or alpha channel in the image for
some operations. This extra channel usually defines a mask which represents
a sort of a cookie-cutter for the image. This is the case when matte is
255 (full coverage) for pixels inside the shape, zero outside, and between
zero and 255 on the boundary. If image does not have a matte channel, it
is initialized with 0 for any pixel matching in color to pixel location
(0,0), otherwise 255. See Matte Editing for a method
of defining a matte channel.

Note that matte information for image window is not retained for colormapped
X server visuals (e.g. \fIStaticColor, StaticColor, GrayScale, PseudoColor\fP).
Correct compositing behavior may require a
\fITrueColor\fP or \fIDirectColor\fP
visual or a \fIStandard Colormap\fP.

Choosing a composite operator is optional. The default operator is replace.
However, you must choose a location to composite your image and press button
1. Press and hold the button before releasing and an outline of the image
will appear to help you identify your location.

The actual colors of the pasted image is saved. However, the color that
appears in image window may be different. For example, on a monochrome
screen image window will appear black or white even though your pasted
image may have many colors. If the image is saved to a file it is written
with the correct colors. To assure the correct colors are saved in the
final image, any \fIPseudoClass\fP image is promoted to \fIDirectClass\fP.
To force a
\fIPseudoClass\fP image to remain \fIPseudoClass\fP,
use \fB-colors\fP.
.SH IMAGE CROPPING

and press any button.

Choose a point in the image window and press this button and hold. Next,
move the pointer to another location in the image. As you move a line connects
the initial location and the pointer. When you release the button, the
degree of image rotation is determined by the slope of the line you just
drew. The slope is relative to the direction you choose from the Direction
sub-menu of the Command widget.

To cancel the image rotation, move the pointer back to the starting point
of the line and release the button.
.SH IMAGE SEGMENTATION

Choose \fBEffects->Segment\fP to segment an image by analyzing the histograms
of the color components and identifying units that are homogeneous with
the fuzzy c-means technique. The scale-space filter analyzes the histograms
of the three color components of the image and identifies a set of classes.
The extents of each class is used to coarsely segment the image with thresholding.
The color associated with each class is determined by the mean color of
all pixels within the extents of a particular class. Finally, any unclassified
pixels are assigned to the closest class with the fuzzy c-means technique.
The fuzzy c-Means algorithm can be summarized as follows:

    
Build a histogram, one for each color component of the image.
    
For each histogram, successively apply the scale-space filter and build
an interval tree of zero crossings in the second derivative at each scale.
Analyze this scale-space "fingerprint" to determine which peaks or valleys
in the histogram are most predominant.
    
The fingerprint defines intervals on the axis of the histogram. Each interval
contains either a minima or a maxima in the original signal. If each color
component lies within the maxima interval, that pixel is considered "classified"
and is assigned an unique class number.
    
Any pixel that fails to be classified in the above thresholding pass is
classified using the fuzzy c-Means technique. It is assigned to one of
the classes discovered in the histogram analysis phase.


The fuzzy c-Means technique attempts to cluster a pixel by finding the
local minima of the generalized within group sum of squared error objective
function. A pixel is assigned to the closest class of which the fuzzy membership
has a maximum value.

\fBDisplace\fP shifts the image pixels as defined by a displacement map.
With this option, \fIimage\fP is used as a displacement map. Black, within
the displacement map, is a maximum positive displacement. White is a maximum
negative displacement and middle gray is neutral. The displacement is scaled
to determine the pixel shift. By default, the displacement applies in both
the horizontal and vertical directions. However, if you specify
\fImask\fP,
\fIimage\fP
is the horizontal X displacement and
\fImask\fP the vertical Y displacement.

Note that matte information for image window is not retained for colormapped

its color. Additional pixels may be recolored as prescribed by the method
you choose. additional pixels by increasing the Delta value.

If the \fBMagnify widget\fP is mapped, it can be helpful in positioning
your pointer within the image (refer to button 2). Alternatively you can
select a pixel to recolor from within the \fBMagnify widget\fP. Move the
pointer to the \fBMagnify widget\fP and position the pixel with the cursor
control keys. Finally, press a button to recolor the selected pixel (or
pixels).

The actual color you request for the pixels is saved in the image. However,
the color that appears in your Image window may be different. For example,
on a monochrome screen the pixel will appear black or white even if you
choose the color red as the pixel color. However, the image saved to a
file with -write is written with red pixels. To assure the correct color
text in the final image, any \fIPseudoClass\fP image is promoted
to \fIDirectClass\fP
To force a \fIPseudoClass\fP image to remain
\fIPseudoClass\fP, use \fB-colors\fP.
.SH MATTE EDITING

Matte information within an image is useful for some operations such as
image compositing. This extra channel usually defines
a mask which represents a sort of a cookie-cutter for the image. This is
the case when matte is 255 (full coverage) for pixels inside the shape,
zero outside, and between zero and 255 on the boundary.

Setting the matte information in an image is done interactively. There
is no command line argument to edit a pixel. To begin, and choose \fBMatte\fP
of the \fBImage Edit\fP sub-menu from the Command widget.

Alternatively, press m in the image window.

A small window appears showing the location of the cursor in the image
window. You are now in matte edit mode. To exit immediately, press Dismiss.
In matte edit mode, the Command widget has these options:

Choose a matte editing method from the \fBMethod\fP sub-menu of the Command
widget. The \fBpoint method\fP changes the matte value of the any
pixel selected with the pointer until the button is released. The \fBreplace
method\fP changes the matte value of any pixel that matches the color
of the pixel you select with a button press. \fBFloodfill\fP changes the
matte value of any pixel that matches the color of the pixel you select
with a button press and is a neighbor. Whereas
\fBfilltoborder\fP recolors
any neighbor pixel that is not the border color. Finally \fBreset\fP changes
the entire image to the designated matte value.
Choose \fBMatte Value\fP and a dialog appears requesting a matte value.
Enter a value between \fB0 and 255\fP. This value is assigned as the matte
value of the selected pixel or pixels.
Now, press any button to select a pixel within the Image window to change
its matte value. You can change the matte value of additional pixels by
increasing the Delta value. The Delta value is first added then subtracted
from the red, green, and blue of the target color. Any pixels within the
range also have their matte value updated.
If the \fBMagnify widget\fP is mapped, it can be helpful in positioning
your pointer within the image (refer to button 2). Alternatively you can
select a pixel to change the matte value from within the
\fBMagnify widget\fP.
Move the pointer to the \fBMagnify widget\fP and position the pixel with
the cursor control keys. Finally, press a button to change the matte value
of the selected pixel (or pixels).
Matte information is only valid in a \fIDirectClass image\fP. Therefore,
any \fIPseudoClass\fP image is promoted to
\fIDirectClass\fP. Note that
matte information for \fIPseudoClass\fP is not retained for colormapped
X server visuals (e.g. \fIStaticColor, StaticColor, GrayScale, PseudoColor\fP)
unless you immediately save your image to a file (refer to Write). Correct
matte editing behavior may require a \fITrueColor\fP or \fIDirectColor\fP
visual or a \fIStandard Colormap\fP.
.SH IMAGE DRAWING

An image is drawn upon interactively. \fBThere is no command line argument
to draw on an image\fP. To begin, choose \fBDraw\fP of the Image \fBEdit\fP
sub-menu from the Command widget.
Alternatively, press d in the image window.

The cursor changes to a crosshair to indicate you are in draw mode. To
exit immediately, press Dismiss. In draw mode, the Command widget has these

Choose a drawing primitive from the \fBPrimitive\fP sub-menu.

Next, choose a color from the \fBColor\fP sub-menu. Additional colors
can be specified with the color browser. You can change the menu colors
by setting the X resources pen1 through pen9. The transparent
color updates the image matte channel and is useful for image compositing.

If you choose the color browser and press \fBGrab\fP, you can select the
primitive color by moving the pointer to the desired color on the screen
and press any button. The transparent color updates the image matte channel
and is useful for image compositing.

Choose a stipple, if appropriate, from the \fBStipple\fP sub-menu. Additional
stipples can be specified with the file browser. Stipples obtained from
the file browser must be on disk in the X11 bitmap format.

Choose a line width, if appropriate, from the \fBWidth\fP sub-menu. To
choose a specific width select the \fBDialog\fP widget.

Choose a point in the image window and press button 1 and hold. Next, move
the pointer to another location in the image. As you move, a line connects
the initial location and the pointer. When you release the button, the
image is updated with the primitive you just drew. For polygons, the image
is updated when you press and release the button without moving the pointer.

To cancel image drawing, move the pointer back to the starting point of
the line and release the button.
.SH REGION OF INTEREST

To begin, press choose Region of Interest of the Pixel Transform sub-menu
from the Command widget.
Alternatively, press R in the image window.

A small window appears showing the location of the cursor in the image
window. You are now in region of interest mode. In region of interest mode,
the Command widget has these options:

You can make adjustments to the region of interest by moving the pointer
to one of the rectangle corners, pressing a button, and dragging. Finally,
choose an image processing technique from the Command widget. You can choose
more than one image processing technique to apply to an area. Alternatively,
you can move the region of interest before applying another image processing
technique. To exit, press Dismiss.
.SH IMAGE PANNING

When an image exceeds the width or height of the X server screen, display
maps a small panning icon. The rectangle within the panning icon shows
the area that is currently displayed in the the image window. To pan about
the image, press any button and drag the pointer within the panning icon.
The pan rectangle moves with the pointer and the image window is updated
to reflect the location of the rectangle within the panning icon. When
you have selected the area of the image you wish to view, release the button.

Use the arrow keys to pan the image one pixel up, down, left, or right
within the image window.

The panning icon is withdrawn if the image becomes smaller than the dimensions
of the X server screen.
.SH USER PREFERENCES

Preferences affect the default behavior of \fBdisplay(1)\fP. The preferences
are either true or false and are stored in your home directory
as .displayrc:
.in 15

.B "
\fBdisplay image centered on a backdrop\fP"
.in 20
 \fR
.in 20

This backdrop covers the entire workstation screen and is useful for hiding
other X window activity while viewing the image. The color of the backdrop
is specified as the background color. Refer to X Resources
for details.
.in 15

The basic strategy of dithering is to trade intensity resolution for spatial
resolution by averaging the intensities of several neighboring pixels.
Images which suffer from severe contouring when reducing colors can be
improved with this preference.

.B "
\fBuse a shared colormap for colormapped X visuals\fP"
.in 20
 \fR
.in 20

This option only applies when the default X server visual is
\fIPseudoColor\fP
or \fIGRAYScale\fP. Refer to \fB-visual\fP for more details. By default,
a shared colormap is allocated. The image shares colors with other X clients.
Some image colors could be approximated, therefore your image may look
very different than intended. Otherwise the image colors appear exactly
as they are defined. However, other clients may go technicolor when the
image colormap is installed.

.B "
\fBdisplay images as an X server pixmap\fP"
.in 20
 \fR
.in 20

Images are maintained as a XImage by default. Set this resource to True
to utilize a server Pixmap instead. This option is useful if your image
exceeds the dimensions of your server screen and you intend to pan the
image. Panning is much faster with Pixmaps than with a XImage. Pixmaps
are considered a precious resource, use them with discretion.
