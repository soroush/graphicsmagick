.SH EXAMPLES
To scale an image of a cockatoo to exactly 640 pixels in width and 480
pixels in height and position the window at location (200,200), use:

.nf
     display -geometry 640x480\+200\+200! cockatoo.miff
.fi

To display an image of a cockatoo without a border centered on a
backdrop, use:

.nf
     display +borderwidth -backdrop cockatoo.miff
.fi

To tile a slate texture onto the root window, use:

.nf
     display -size 1280x1024 -window root slate.png
.fi

To display a visual image directory of all your JPEG images, use:

.nf
     display 'vid:*.jpg'
.fi

To display a MAP image that is 640 pixels in width and 480
pixels in height with 256 colors, use:

.nf
     display -size 640x480\+256 cockatoo.map
.fi

To display an image specified with a World Wide Web (WWW) uniform
resource locator (URL), use

.nf
     display ftp://ftp.imagemagick.org/pub/ImageMagick/images/examples.jpg
.fi
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B "-backdrop"
display the image centered on a backdrop.

This backdrop covers the entire workstation screen and is useful for
hiding other X window activity while viewing the image.   The color of
the backdrop is specified as the background color.  Refer to \fBX
RESOURCES\fP for details.
.TP
.B "-border \fI<width>x<height>\fP"
surround the image with a border of color.  See \fBX(1)\fP for details
about the geometry specification.

The color of the border is obtained from the X server and is defined as
\fBbordercolor\fP (class \fBborderColor\fP).  See \fBX(1)\fP for details.
.TP
.B "-cache \fIthreshold\fP"
megabytes of memory available to the pixel cache.

Image pixels are stored in memory until 80 megabytes of memory
have been consumed.  Subsequent pixel operations are cached on disk.
Operations to memory are significantly faster but if your computer does not
have a sufficient amount of free memory you may want to adjust this threshold
value.
.TP
.B "-colormap \fItype\fP"
the type of colormap: \fBShared\fP or \fBPrivate\fP.

This option only applies when the default X server visual is
\fIPseudoColor\fP or \fIGrayScale\fP.  Refer to \fB-visual\fP for more
details.  By default, a shared colormap is allocated.  The image shares
colors with other X clients.  Some image colors could be approximated,
therefore your image may look very different than intended.  Choose
\fBPrivate\fP and the image colors appear exactly as they are
defined.  However, other clients may go \fItechnicolor\fP when the image
colormap is installed.
.TP
.B "-colors \fIvalue\fP"
preferred number of colors in the image.

The actual number of colors in the image may be less than your request,
but never more.  Note, this is a color reduction option.  Images with
less unique colors than specified with this option will have any duplicate
or unused colors removed.
Refer to \fBquantize(9)\fP for more details.

Note, options \fB-dither\fP, \fB-colorspace\fP, and \fB-treedepth\fP affect
the color reduction algorithm.
.TP
.B "-colorspace \fIvalue\fP"
the type of colorspace: \fBGRAY\fP, \fBOHTA\fP, \fBRGB\fP,
\fBTransparent\fP, \fBXYZ\fP, \fBYCbCr\fP, \fBYIQ\fP, \fBYPbPr\fP,
\fBYUV\fP, or \fBCMYK\fP.

Color reduction, by default, takes place in the RGB color space.
Empirical evidence suggests that distances in color spaces such as YUV
or YIQ correspond to perceptual color differences more closely
than do distances in RGB space.  These color spaces may give better
results when color reducing an image.  Refer to \fBquantize(9)\fP for
more details.

The \fBTransparent\fP color space behaves uniquely in that it preserves
the matte channel of the image if it exists.

The \fB-colors\fP or \fB-monochrome\fP option is required for this option
to take effect.
.TP
.B "-comment \fIstring\fP"
annotate an image with a comment.

By default, each image is commented with its file name.  Use this
option to assign a specific comment to the image.  Optionally you can
include the image filename, type, width, height, or other image
attributes by embedding special format characters:

.nf
    %b   file size
    %c   comment
    %d   directory
    %e   filename extention
    %f   filename
    %h   height
    %i   input filename
    %k   number of unique colors
    %l   label
    %m   magick
    %n   number of scenes
    %o   output filename
    %p   page number
    %q   quantum depth
    %s   scene number
    %t   top of filename
    %u   unique temporary filename
    %w   width
    %x   x resolution
    %y   y resolution
    \\n   newline
    \\r   carriage return
.fi

For example,

.nf
     -comment "%m:%f %wx%h"
.fi

produces an image comment of \fBMIFF:bird.miff 512x480\fP for an image
titled \fBbird.miff\fP and whose width is 512 and height is 480.

If the first character of \fIstring\fP is \fB@\fP, the image comment is read
from a file titled by the remaining characters in the string.
.TP
.B "-compress \fItype\fP"
the type of image compression: \fINone\fP, \fIBZip\fP, \fIFax\fP, \fIGroup4\fP,
\fIJPEG\fP, \fILZW\fP, \fIRLE\fP, or \fIZip\fP.

Use this option with \fB-write\fP to specify the the type of image
compression.  See \fBmiff(5)\fP for details.

Specify \fB\+compress\fP to store the binary image in an uncompressed format.
The default is the compression type of the specified image file.
.TP
.B "-contrast"
enhance or reduce the image contrast.

This option enhances the intensity differences between the
lighter and darker elements of the image.  Use \fB-contrast\fP to
enhance the image or \fB+contrast\fP to reduce the image contrast.
.TP
.B "-crop \fI<width>x<height>{\+-}<x offset>{\+-}<y offset>{%}\fP"
preferred size and location of the cropped image.  See \fBX(1)\fP for details
about the geometry specification.

To specify a percentage width or height instead, append \fB%\fP.  For example
to crop the image by ten percent on all sides of the image, use
\fB-crop 10%\fP.

Use cropping to apply image processing options to, or display, a
particular area of an image.

Use cropping to crop a particular area of an image.   Use \fB-crop
0x0\fP to trim edges that are the background color.  Add an x and y offset
to leave a portion of the trimmed edges with the image.

The equivalent X resource for this option is \fBcropGeometry\fP
(class \fBCropGeometry\fP).  See \fBX RESOURCES\fP for details.
.TP
.B "-delay \fI<1/100ths of a second>\fP"
display the next image after pausing.

This option is useful when viewing several images in sequence.
\fI1/100ths of a second\fP must expire before the
next image is displayed.  The delay is rounded to the nearest second.
The default is to display the image and wait until you choose to display
the next image or terminate the program.
.TP
.B "-density \fI<width>x<height>\fP
vertical and horizontal resolution in pixels of the image.

This option specifies an image density when decoding a Postscript or Portable
Document page.  The default is the same as the resolution of your X server
(see \fBxdpyinfo(1)\fP).  This option is used in concert with \fB-page\fP.
.TP
.B "-depth \fIvalue\fP"
depth of the image.  This is the number of bits in a pixel.  The only
acceptable values are 8 or 16.
.TP
.B "-despeckle"
reduce the speckles within an image.
.TP
.B "-display \fIhost:display[.screen]\fP"
specifies the X server to contact; see \fBX(1)\fP.
.TP
.B "-dispose \fImethod\fP"
GIF disposal method.

Here are the valid methods:

.nf
     0     No disposal specified.
     1     Do not dispose between frames.
     2     Overwrite frame with background color from header.
     3     Overwrite with previous frame.
.fi
.TP
.B "-dither"
apply Floyd/Steinberg error diffusion to the image.

The basic strategy of dithering is to trade intensity resolution for
spatial resolution by averaging the intensities of several neighboring
pixels.  Images which suffer from severe contouring when reducing colors
can be improved with this option.

The \fB-colors\fP or \fB-monochrome\fP option is required for this option
to take effect.

Use \fB+dither\fP to render Postscript without text or graphic aliasing.
.TP
.B "-edge \fIfactor\fP"
detect edges with an image.  Specify \fIfactor\fP as the percent enhancement
(0.0 - 99.9%).
.TP
.B "-enhance"
apply a digital filter to enhance a noisy image.
.TP
.B "-filter \fIvalue\fP"
use this type of filter when resizing an image.

Use this option to affect the resizing operation of an image (see
\fB-geometry\fP).  Choose from these filters:

.nf
     Point
     Box
     Triangle
     Hermite
     Hanning
     Hamming
     Blackman
     Gaussian
     Quadratic
     Cubic
     Catrom
     Mitchell
     Lanczos
     Bessel
     Sinc
.fi

The default filter is \fBLanczos\fP.

.TP
.B "-flip"
create a "mirror image" by reflecting the image scanlines in the vertical
direction.
.TP
.B "-flop"
create a "mirror image" by reflecting the image scanlines in the horizontal
direction.
.TP
.B "-frame \fI<width>x<height>+<outer bevel width>+<inner bevel width>\fP"
surround the image with an ornamental border.  See \fBX(1)\fP for details
about the geometry specification.

The color of the border is specified with the \fB-mattecolor\fP command line
option.
.TP
.B "-gamma \fIvalue\fP"
level of gamma correction.

The same color image displayed on two different workstations may look
different due to differences in the display monitor.  Use gamma
correction to adjust for this color difference.  Reasonable values
extend from 0.8 to 2.3.

You can apply separate gamma values to the red, green, and blue
channels of the image with a gamma value list delineated with slashes
(i.e. 1.7/2.3/1.2).

Use \fB+gamma\fP to set the image gamma level without actually adjusting
the image pixels.  This option is useful if the image is of a known
gamma but not set as an image attribute (e.g. PNG images).
.TP
.B "-geometry \fI<width>x<height>{\+-}<x offset>{\+-}<y offset>{%}{@}{!}{<}{>}\fP"
preferred size and location of the image window.  See \fBX(1)\fP for details
about the geometry specification.  By default, the window size is the image
size and the location is chosen by you when it is mapped.

By default, the width and height are maximum values.  That is, the
image is expanded or contracted to fit the width and height value while
maintaining the aspect ratio of the image.  Append an exclamation point
to the geometry to force the image size to exactly the size you
specify.  For example, if you specify \fB640x480!\fP the image width is
set to 640 pixels and height to 480.  If only one factor is
specified, both the width and height assume the value.

To specify a percentage width or height instead, append \fB%\fP.  The
image size is multiplied by the width and height percentages to obtain
the final image dimensions.  To increase the size of an image, use a
value greater than 100 (e.g. 125%).  To decrease an image's size, use a
percentage less than 100.

Use \fB@\fP to specify the maximum area in pixels of an image.

Use \fB>\fP to change the dimensions of the image \fIonly\fP
if its size exceeds the geometry specification.  \fB<\fP resizes
the image \fIonly\fP if its dimensions is less than the geometry
specification.  For example, if you specify \fB'640x480>'\fP and the
image size is 512x512, the image size does not change.  However, if
the image is 1024x1024, it is resized to 640x480.

When displaying an image on an X server, \fI<x offset>\fP and
\fI<y offset>\fP is relative to the root window.

The equivalent X resource for this option is \fBgeometry\fP
(class \fBGeometry\fP).  See \fBX RESOURCES\fP for details.
.TP
.B "-interlace \fItype\fP"
the type of interlacing scheme: \fBNone\fP, \fBLine\fP, \fBPlane\fP, or
\fBPartition\fP.  The default is \fBNone\fP.

This option is used to specify the type of interlacing scheme for raw
image formats such as \fBRGB\fP or \fBYUV\fP.  \fBNo\fP means do not
interlace (RGBRGBRGBRGBRGBRGB...), \fBLine\fP uses scanline
interlacing (RRR...GGG...BBB...RRR...GGG...BBB...), and \fBPlane\fP uses
plane interlacing (RRRRRR...GGGGGG...BBBBBB...).  \fBPartition\fP is like
plane except the different planes are saved to individual files (e.g.
image.R, image.G, and image.B).

Use \fBLine\fP, or \fBPlane\fP to create an interlaced GIF or progressive
JPEG image.
.TP
.B "-immutable"
displayed image cannot be modified",
.TP
.B "-label \fIstring\fP"
assign a label to an image.

Use this option to assign a specific label to the image.  Optionally
you can include the image filename, type, width, height, or other image
attribute in the label by embedding special format characters. 
See \fB-comment\fP for details.

For example,

.nf
     -label "%m:%f %wx%h"
.fi

produces an image label of \fBMIFF:bird.miff 512x480\fP for an image
titled \fBbird.miff\fP and whose width is 512 and height is 480.

If the first character of \fIstring\fP is \fB@\fP, the image label is read
from a file titled by the remaining characters in the string.

When converting to Postscript, use this option to specify a header string
to print above the image.  Specify the label font with \fB-font\fP.
.TP
.B "-map \fItype\fP"
display image using this Standard Colormap type.

Choose from these Standard Colormap types:

    best
    default
    gray
    red
    green
    blue

The X server must support the Standard Colormap you choose, otherwise an
error occurs.  Use \fBlist\fP as the type and \fBdisplay(1)\fP searches
the list of colormap types in top-to-bottom order until one is located. See
\fBxstdcmap(1)\fP for one way of creating Standard Colormaps.
.TP
.B "-matte"
store matte channel if the image has one otherwise create an opaque one.
.TP
.B "-monochrome"
transform the image to black and white.
.TP
.B "-negate"
replace every pixel with its complementary color (white becomes black, yellow
becomes blue, etc.).

The red, green, and blue intensities of an image are negated.   Use
\fB+negate\fP to only negate the grayscale pixels of the image.
.TP
.B "-page \fI<width>x<height>{\+-}<x offset>{\+-}<y offset>{%}{!}{<}{>}\fP"
preferred size and location of an image canvas.

Use this option to specify the dimensions of the Postscript page in
dots per inch or a TEXT page in pixels.  The choices for a Postscript page are:

.nf
    Letter      612x 792
    Tabloid     792x1224
    Ledger     1224x 792
    Legal       612x1008
    Statement   396x 612
    Executive   540x 720
    A3          842x1190
    A4          595x 842
    A5          420x 595
    B4          729x1032
    B5          516x 729
    Folio       612x 936
    Quarto      610x 780
    10x14       720x1008
.fi

For convenience you can specify the page size by media (e.g.
A4, Ledger, etc.).  Otherwise, \fB-page\fP behaves much like \fB-geometry\fP
(e.g. -page letter+43+43>).

To position a GIF image, use -page \fI{\+-}<x offset>{\+-}<y offset>\fP
(e.g. -page +100+200).

For a Postscript page, the image is sized as in \fB-geometry\fP and
positioned relative to the lower left hand corner of the page by
\fI{\+-}<x offset>{\+-}<y offset>\fP.  Use -page 612x792>, for example,
to center the image within the page.  If the image size exceeds the
Postscript page, it is reduced to fit the page.

The default page dimensions for a TEXT image is 612x792.

This option is used in concert with \fB-density\fP.
.TP
.B "-quality \fIvalue\fP"
JPEG/MIFF/PNG compression level.

For the JPEG image format, quality is 0 (worst) to 100 (best).  The default
quality is 75.

Quality for the MIFF and PNG image format sets the amount of image compression
(quality / 10) and filter-type (quality % 10).  Compression quality
values range from 0 (worst) to 100 (best).  If filter-type is 4
or less, the specified filter-type is used for all scanlines:

.nf
    0: none
    1: sub
    2: up
    3: average
    4: Paeth
.fi

If filter-type is 5, adaptive filtering is used when quality
is greater than 50 and the image does not have a color map,
otherwise no filtering is used.

If filter-type is 6 or more, adaptive filtering with
\fIminimum-sum-of-absolute-values\fP is used.

The default is quality is 75.  Which means nearly the best compression
with adaptive filtering.

For further information, see the PNG specification (RFC 2083),
<http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/TR>.
.TP
.B "-raise \fI<width>x<height>\fP"
lighten or darken image edges to create a 3-D effect.    See \fBX(1)\fP for
details about the geometry specification.

Use \fB-raise\fP to create a raised effect, otherwise use \fB+raise\fP.
.TP
.B "-remote \fIstring\fP"
execute a command in an remote display process.

The only command recognized at this time is the name of an image file to
load.
.TP
.B "-roll \fI{\+-}<x offset>{\+-}<y offset>\fP"
roll an image vertically or horizontally.  See \fBX(1)\fP for details
about the geometry specification.

A negative \fIx offset\fP rolls the image left-to-right.  A negative
\fIy offset\fP rolls the image top-to-bottom.
.TP
.B "-rotate \fIdegrees{<}{>}\fP"
apply Paeth image rotation to the image.

Use \fB>\fP to rotate the image \fIonly\fP if its width exceeds the
height.  \fB<\fP rotates the image \fIonly\fP if its width is less than
the height.  For example, if you specify \fB-90>\fP and the image size
is 480x640, the image is not rotated by the specified angle.  However,
if the image is 640x480, it is rotated by -90 degrees.

Empty triangles left over from rotating the image are filled with
the color defined as \fBbordercolor\fP (class \fBborderColor\fP).
.TP
.B "-sample \fIgeometry\fP"
scale image with pixel sampling.  See \fB-geometry\fP for details
about the geometry specification.
.TP
.B "-scene \fIvalue\fP"
image scene number.

Use this option to specify an image sequence with a single filename.  See
the discussion of \fIfile\fP below for details.
.TP
.B "-segment \fIvalue\fP"
eliminate clusters that are insignificant.

The number of pixels in each cluster must exceed the
the cluster threshold to be considered valid.

See \fBIMAGE SEGMENTATION\fB for details.
.TP
.B "-sharpen \fI<radius>x<sigma>\fP"
sharpen the image with a gaussian operator of the given radius and
standard deviation (sigma).
.TP
.B "-size \fI<width>x<height>+<offset>\fP"
width and height of the image.

Use this option to specify the width and height of raw images whose
dimensions are unknown such as \fBGRAY\fP, \fBRGB\fP, or \fBCMYK\fP.
In addition to width and height, use \fB-size\fP to skip any header
information in the image or tell the number of colors in a \fBMAP\fP
image file, (e.g. -size 640x512+256).

For Photo CD images, choose from these sizes:

.nf
      192x128
      384x256
      768x512
     1536x1024
     3072x2048
.fi

Finally, use this option to choose a particular resolution layer of a JBIG
or JPEG image (e.g. -size 1024x768).
.TP
.B "-texture \fIfilename\fP"
name of texture to tile onto the image background.
.TP
.B "-title \fIstring\fP"
assign a title to the displayed image.

Use this option to assign a specific title to the image.  This is
assigned to the image window and is typically displayed in the window
title bar.   Optionally you can include the image filename, type, width,
height, or other image attributes by embedding special format characters.
See \fB-comment\fP for details.

For example,

.nf
     -title "%m:%f %wx%h"
.fi

produces an image title of \fBMIFF:bird.miff 512x480\fP for an image
titled \fBbird.miff\fP and whose width is 512 and height is 480.
.TP
.B "-treedepth \fIvalue\fP"
Normally, this integer value is zero or one.  A zero or one tells
\fBdisplay\fP to choose a optimal tree depth for the color reduction
algorithm.

An optimal depth generally allows the best representation of the source
image with the fastest computational speed and the least amount of
memory.  However, the default depth is inappropriate for some images.
To assure the best representation, try values between 2 and 8 for this
parameter.  Refer to \fBquantize(9)\fP for more details.

The \fB-colors\fP or \fB-monochrome\fP option is required
for this option to take effect.
.TP
.B "-update \fIseconds\fP"
detect when image file is modified and redisplay.

Suppose that while you are displaying an image the file that is
currently displayed is over-written.  \fBdisplay\fP will automatically
detect that the input file has been changed and update the displayed
image accordingly.
.TP
.B -verbose
print detailed information about the image.

This information is printed: image scene number;  image name;  image
size; the image class (\fIDirectClass\fP or \fIPseudoClass\fP);  the total
number of unique colors;  and the number of seconds to read and
transform the image.  Refer to \fBmiff(5)\fP for a description of
the image class.

If \fB-colors\fP is also specified, the total unique colors in the image
and color reduction error values are printed.  Refer to \fBquantize(9)\fP
for a description of these values.
.TP
.B "-visual \fItype\fP"
display image using this visual type.

Choose from these visual classes:

.nf
     StaticGray
     GrayScale
     StaticColor
     PseudoColor
     TrueColor
     DirectColor
     default
     \fIvisual id\fP
.fi

The X server must support the visual you choose, otherwise an error occurs.
If a visual is not specified, the visual class that can display the most
simultaneous colors on the default X server screen is chosen.
.TP
.B "-window \fIid\fP"
set the background pixmap of this window to the image.

\fIid\fP can be a window id or name.  Specify \fBroot\fP to select X's root
window as the target window.

By default the image is tiled onto the background of the target
window.   If \fB-backdrop\fP or \fB-geometry\fP are specified, the
image is surrounded by the background color.  Refer to \fBX
RESOURCES\fP for details.

The image will not display on the root window if the image has more
unique colors than the target window colormap allows.  Use
\fB-colors\fP to reduce the number of colors.
.B "-window_group \fIid\fP"
exit program when this window id is destroyed.

\fIid\fP can be a window id or name.
.TP
.B "-write \fIfilename\fP"
write image to a file.

If \fIfile\fP already exists, you will be prompted as to whether
it should be overwritten.

By default, the image is written in the format that it was read in as.
To specify a particular image format, prefix \fIfile\fP with the image
type and a colon (i.e. ps:image) or specify the image type as the
filename suffix (i.e. image.ps).  See \fBconvert(1)\fP for a list of
valid image formats.  Specify \fIfile\fP as \fI-\fP for standard
output.  If \fIfile\fP has the extension \fB.Z\fP or \fB.gz\fP, the
file size is compressed using with \fBcompress\fP or \fBgzip\fP
respectively.  Precede the image file name \fI|\fP to pipe to a system
command. If \fIfile\fP already exists, you will be prompted as to
whether it should be overwritten.

Use \fB-compress\fP to specify the type of image compression.

The equivalent X resource for this option is \fBwriteFilename\fP
(class \fBWriteFilename\fP).  See \fBX RESOURCES\fP for details.
.PP
In addition to those listed above, you can specify these standard X
resources as command line options:  \fB-background\fP,
\fB-bordercolor\fP, \fB-borderwidth\fP, \fB-font\fP, \fB-foreground\fP,
\fB-iconGeometry\fP, \fB-iconic\fP, \fB-mattecolor\fP, \fB-name\fP,
or \fB-title\fP.  See \fBX RESOURCES\fP for details.

Options are processed in command line order.
Any option you specify on the command line remains in effect until it is
explicitly changed by specifying the option again with a different effect.
For example to display two images, the first with 32 colors, and the
second with only 16 colors, use:

.nf
     display -colors 32 cockatoo.miff -colors 16 macaw.miff
.fi

By default, the image format is determined by its magic number. To
specify a particular image format, precede the filename with an image
format name and a colon (i.e. ps:image) or specify the image type as
the filename suffix (i.e. image.ps).  See \fBconvert(1)\fP for a list
of valid image formats.

When you specify \fBX\fP as your image type, the filename has special
meaning.  It specifies an X window by id, name, or \fBroot\fP.  If no
filename is specified, the window is selected by clicking the mouse in
the desired window.

Specify \fIfile\fP as \fI-\fP for standard input.  If \fIfile\fP has
the extension \fB.Z\fP or \fB.gz\fP, the file is uncompressed with
\fBuncompress\fP or \fBgunzip\fP respectively.  Precede the image file
name \fI|\fP to pipe from a system command.

Use an optional index enclosed in brackets after a file name to specify
a desired subimage of a multi-resolution image format like Photo CD
(e.g. img0001.pcd[4]) or a range for MPEG images (e.g. video.mpg[50-75]).
A subimage specification can be disjoint (e.g. image.tiff[2,7,4]).
For raw images, specify a subimage with a geometry (e.g.  -size 640x512
image.rgb[320x256+50+50]).

Single images are read with the filename you specify.  Alternatively,
you can display an image sequence with a single filename.  Define the
range of the image sequence with \fI-scene\fP.  Each image in the
range is read with the filename followed by a period (\fB.\fP)
and the scene number.  You can change this behavior by embedding a
\fBprintf\fP format specification in the file name.  For example,

.nf
     -scene 0-9 image%02d.miff
.fi

displays files image00.miff, image01.miff, through image09.miff.
.SH BUTTONS
The effects of each button press is described below.  Three buttons are
required.  If you have a two button mouse, button 1 and 3 are returned.
Press ALT and button 3 to simulate button 2.
.TP
.B "1"

windows initially not be visible as if the windows had be immediately
iconified by you.  Window managers may choose not to honor the
application's request.
.TP
.B magnify (\fIclass\fP Magnify)
specifies an integral factor by which the image should be enlarged.  The
default is 3.

This value only affects the magnification window which is invoked with
button number 3 after the image is displayed.  Refer to \fBBUTTONS\fP
for more details.
.TP
.B matteColor (\fIclass\fP MatteColor)

resource is ignored.  The default is True.
.TP
.B textFont (\fIclass\fP textFont)
Specifies the name of the preferred font to use in fixed (typewriter style)
formatted text.  The default is 14 point \fICourier\fP.
.TP
.B title (\fIclass\fP Title)
This resource specifies the title to be used for the image window.  This
information is sometimes used by a window manager to provide a
header identifying the window.  The default is the image file name.
.TP
.B undoCache (\fIclass\fP UndoCache)
Specifies, in mega-bytes, the amount of memory in the undo edit cache.  Each
time you modify the image it is saved in the undo edit cache as long as memory
is available.  You can subsequently \fIundo\fP one or more of these
transformations.  The default is 16 mega-bytes.
.TP
.B usePixmap (\fIclass\fP UsePixmap)
Images are maintained as a XImage by default.  Set this resource to True
to utilize a server Pixmap instead.  This option is useful if your image
exceeds the dimensions of your server screen and you intend to pan the
image.  Panning is much faster with Pixmaps than with a XImage.
Pixmaps are considered a precious resource, use them with discretion.

To set the geometry of the \fIMagnify\fP or \fIPan\fP or window, use the
\fIgeometry\fP resource.  For example, to set the Pan window geometry
to 256x256, use:

.nf
     display.pan.geometry: 256x256
.fi

.SH IMAGE LOADING
To select an image to display, choose \fBOpen\fP of the \fBFile\fP sub-menu

the current directory, press \fBDirectory\fP or press the RETURN key.
Alternatively, you can select a set of image names by using shell
globbing characters.  For example, type \fB*.jpg\fP to include only
files that end with \fB.jpg\fP.  To descend directories, choose a
directory name and press the button twice quickly.  A scrollbar allows
a large list of filenames to be moved through the viewing area if it
exceeds the size of the list area.

After you select a set of files, they are turned into thumbnails and
tiled onto a single image.  Now move the pointer to a particular
thumbnail and press button 3 and drag.  Finally, select \fBOpen\fP.  The
image represented by the thumbnail is displayed at its full size.
Choose \fBNext\fP from the \fBFile\fP sub-menu of the Command widget to

Choose a composite operation from the \fBOperators\fP sub-menu of the
Command widget.  How each operator behaves is described below.
\fIimage window\fP is the image currently displayed on your X server and
\fIimage\fP is the image obtained with the File Browser widget.

.TP
.B Over
The result is the union of the two image shapes, with \fIimage\fP
obscuring \fIimage window\fP in the region of overlap.
.TP
.B In
The result is simply \fIimage\fP cut by the shape of \fIimage
window\fP.  None of the image data of \fIimage window\fP is in the
result.
.TP
.B Out
The resulting image is \fIimage\fP with the shape of \fIimage window\fP
cut out.
.TP
.B Atop
The result is the same shape as image \fIimage window\fP, with
\fIimage\fP obscuring \fIimage window\fP where the image shapes
overlap.  Note this differs from \fBover\fP because the portion of
\fIimage\fP outside \fIimage window\fP's shape does not appear in the
result.
.TP
.B Xor
The result is the image data from both \fIimage\fP and \fIimage window\fP
that is outside the overlap region.  The overlap region is blank.
.TP
.B Plus
The result is just the sum of the image data.  Output values are
cropped to 255 (no overflow).  This operation is independent
of the matte channels.
.TP
.B Minus
The result of \fIimage\fP \- \fIimage window\fP, with underflow cropped
to zero.  The matte channel is ignored (set to 255, full coverage).
.TP
.B Add
The result of \fIimage\fP + \fIimage window\fP, with overflow wrapping
around (\fImod\fP 256).
.TP
.B Subtract
The result of \fIimage\fP - \fIimage window\fP, with underflow wrapping
around (\fImod\fP 256).  The \fBadd\fP and \fBsubtract\fP operators can
be used to perform reversible transformations.
.TP
.B Difference
The result of abs(\fIimage\fP \- \fIimage window\fP).  This is useful
for comparing two very similar images.
.TP
.B Multipy
The result of \fIcomposite image\fP \* \fIimage\fP.  This is useful for
the creation of drop-shadows.
.TP
.B Bumpmap
The result of \fIimage window \fP shaded by \fIimage\fP.
.TP
.B Copy
The resulting image is \fIimage window\fP replaced with \fIimage\fP.
Here the matte information is ignored.
.TP
.B CopyRed
The resulting image is the red layer of \fIimage window\fP replaced with
the red layer of \fIimage\fP.  The remaining layers remain untouched.
.TP
.B CopyGreen
The resulting image is the green layer of \fIimage window\fP replaced with
the green layer of \fIimage\fP.  The remaining layers remain untouched.
.TP
.B CopyBlue
The resulting image is the blue layer of \fIimage window\fP replaced with
the blue layer of \fIimage\fP.  The remaining layers remain untouched.
.TP
.B CopyOpacity
The resulting image is the matte layer of \fIimage window\fP replaced with
the matte layer of \fIimage\fP.  The remaining layers remain untouched.

The image compositor requires a matte, or alpha channel in the image
for some operations.  This extra channel usually defines a mask which
represents a sort of a cookie-cutter for the image.  This is the case
when matte is 255 (full coverage) for pixels inside the shape, zero
outside, and between zero and 255 on the boundary.  If \fIimage\fP does
not have a matte channel, it is initialized with 0 for any pixel
matching in color to pixel location (0,0), otherwise 255.  See
\fBMATTE EDITING\fP for a method of defining a matte channel.

Note that matte information for \fIimage window\fP is not retained for
colormapped X server visuals (e.g. \fIStaticColor\fP,
\fIStaticColor\fP, \fIGrayScale\fP, \fIPseudoColor\fP).  Correct
compositing behavior may require a \fITrueColor\fP or \fIDirectColor\fP
visual or a \fIStandard Colormap\fP.

Choosing a composite operator is optional.  The default operator is
\fIreplace\fP.  However, you must choose a location to composite your image
and press button 1.  Press and hold the button before releasing and an
outline of the image will appear to help you identify your location.

The actual colors of the pasted image is saved.  However, the color
that appears in \fIimage window\fP may be different.  For example, on a
monochrome screen \fIimage window\fP will appear black or white even
though your pasted image may have many colors.  If the image is
saved to a file it is written with the correct colors.  To assure the
correct colors are saved in the final image, any \fIPseudoClass\fP
image is promoted to \fIDirectClass\fP (see \fBmiff(5)\fP).  To force a
\fIPseudoClass\fP image to remain \fIPseudoClass\fP, use \fB-colors\fP.
.SH IMAGE CROPPING
To begin, press choose \fBCrop\fP of the \fBTransform\fP sub-menu from
the Command widget (see \fBCOMMAND WIDGET\fP).  Alternatively, press \fB[\fP
in the image window (see \fBKEYBOARD ACCELERATORS\fP).

A small window appears showing the location of the cursor in the image
window.  You are now in \fIcrop\fP mode.  In \fIcrop\fP mode, the Command
widget has these options:

.nf
    Help
    Dismiss
.fi

To define a cropping region, press button 1 and drag.  The cropping
region is defined by a highlighted rectangle that expands or contracts
as it follows the pointer.  Once you are satisfied with the cropping
region, release the button.  You are now in \fIrectify\fP mode.
In \fIrectify\fP mode, the Command widget has these options:

.nf
    Crop
    Help
    Dismiss
.fi

You can make adjustments by moving the pointer to one of the cropping
rectangle corners, pressing a button, and dragging.
Finally, press \fBCrop\fP to commit your cropping region.  To exit without
cropping the image, press \fBDismiss\fP.
.SH IMAGE CHOPPING
An image is chopped interactively.  There is no command line argument to
chop an image.  To begin, choose \fBChop\fP of the \fBTransform\fP
sub-menu from the Command widget (see \fBCOMMAND WIDGET\fP).  Alternatively,
press \fB]\fP in the image window (see \fBKEYBOARD ACCELERATORS\fP).

You are now in \fIChop\fP mode.  To exit immediately, press \fBDismiss\fP.
In \fIChop\fP mode, the Command widget has these options:

.nf
    Direction

.fi

If the you choose the \fBhorizontal\fP direction (this is the default),
the area of the image between the two horizontal endpoints of the chop
line is removed.  Otherwise, the area of the image between the two
vertical endpoints of the chop line is removed.

Select a location within the image window to begin your chop, press and hold
any button.  Next, move the pointer to another location in the image.  As you
move a line will connect the initial location and the pointer.  When you
release the button, the area within the image to chop is determined by
which direction you choose from the Command widget.

To cancel the image chopping, move the pointer back to the starting
point of the line and release the button.
.SH IMAGE ROTATION
Press the \fB/\fP key to rotate the image 90 degrees or \fB\\\fP to
rotate -90 degrees (see \fBKEYBOARD ACCELERATORS\fP).  To interactively
choose the degree of rotation, choose \fBRotate...\fP of the \fBPixel
Transform\fP submenu from the Command Widget (see \fBCOMMAND
WIDGET\fP).  Alternatively, press \fI*\fP in the image window (see
\fBKEYBOARD ACCELERATORS\fP).

A small horizontal line is drawn next to the pointer.  You are now in
\fIrotate\fP mode.  To exit immediately, press \fBDismiss\fP.
In \fIrotate\fP mode, the Command widget has these options:

Choose a background color from the \fBPixel Color\fP sub-menu.
Additional background colors can be specified with the color browser.
You can change the menu colors by setting the X resources \fBpen1\fP
through \fBpen9\fP.  Refer to \fBX RESOURCES\fP for more details.

If you choose the color browser and press \fBGrab\fP, you can select
the background color by moving the pointer to the desired color on the
screen and press any button. The transparent color updates the image
matte channel and is useful for image compositing.

Choose a point in the image window and press this button and hold.
Next, move the pointer to another location in the image.  As you move a
line connects the initial location and the pointer.  When you release
the button, the degree of image rotation is determined by the slope of
the line you just drew.  The slope is relative to the direction you
choose from the \fBDirection\fP sub-menu of the Command widget.

To cancel the image rotation, move the pointer back to the starting
point of the line and release the button.
.SH IMAGE ANNOTATION
An image is annotated interactively.  There is no command line argument
to annotate an image.  To begin, choose \fIAnnotate\fP of the \fBImage
Edit\fP sub-menu from the Command widget (see \fBCOMMAND WIDGET\fP).
Alternatively, press \fIa\fP in the image window (see \fBKEYBOARD
ACCELERATORS\fP).

A small window appears showing the location of the cursor in the image

Choose a font name from the \fBFont Name\fP sub-menu.
Additional font names can be specified with the font browser.
You can change the menu names by setting the X resources \fBfont1\fP
through \fBfont9\fP.  Refer to \fBX RESOURCES\fP for more details.

Choose a font color from the \fBFont Color\fP sub-menu.
Additional font colors can be specified with the color browser.
You can change the menu colors by setting the X resources \fBpen1\fP
through \fBpen9\fP.  Refer to \fBX RESOURCES\fP for more details.

If you select the color browser and press \fBGrab\fP, you can choose
the font color by moving the pointer to the desired color on the screen
and press any button.

If you choose to rotate the text, choose Rotate Text from the
menu and select an angle.  Typically you will only want to
rotate one line of text at a time.  Depending on the angle you
choose, subsequent lines may end up overwriting each other.

Choosing a font and its color is optional.  The default font is
\fIfixed\fP and the default color is \fIblack\fP.  However, you must
choose a location to begin entering text and press button 1.  An
underscore character will appear at the location of the pointer.  The
cursor changes to a pencil to indicate you are in \fItext\fP mode.  To
exit immediately, press \fBDismiss\fP.

In \fItext\fP mode, any key presses will display the character at
the location of the underscore and advance the underscore cursor.
Enter your text and once completed press \fBDismiss\fP to finish your image
annotation.  To correct errors press \fBBACK SPACE\fP.  To delete an
entire line of text, press \fBDELETE\fP.  Any text that exceeds the
boundaries of the image window is automatically continued onto the next
line.

The actual color you request for the font is saved in the image.
However, the color that appears in your image window may be different.
For example, on a monochrome screen the text will appear black or white even
if you choose the color red as the font color.  However, the image saved to
a file with \fB-write\fP is written with red lettering.  To assure
the correct color text in the final image, any \fIPseudoClass\fP image
is promoted to \fIDirectClass\fP (see \fBmiff(5)\fP).  To
force a \fIPseudoClass\fP image to remain \fIPseudoClass\fP, use
\fB-colors\fP.
.SH IMAGE COMPOSITING
An image composite is created interactively.  There is no command line
argument to composite an image.  To begin, choose \fBComposite\fP of
the \fBImage Edit\fP from the Command widget (see \fBCOMMAND
WIDGET\fP).  Alternatively, press \fIx\fP in the image window (see
\fBKEYBOARD ACCELERATORS\fP).

First a popup window is displayed requesting you to enter an image name.
Press \fBComposite\fP, \fBGrab\fP or type a file name.  Press \fBCancel\fP
if you choose not to create a composite image.  When you choose \fBGrab\fP,
move the pointer to the desired window and press any button.

If the \fBComposite\fP image does not have any matte information, you
are informed and the file browser is displayed again.  Enter the name
of a mask image.  The image is typically grayscale and the same size as the
composite image.  If the image is not grayscale, it is converted to
grayscale and the resulting intensities are used as matte information.

A small window appears showing the location of the cursor in the image
window. You are now in \fIcomposite\fP mode.  To exit immediately,
press \fBDismiss\fP.  In \fIcomposite\fP mode, the Command widget has these

matching in color to pixel location (0,0), otherwise 255.  See
\fBMATTE EDITING\fP for a method of defining a matte channel.

If you choose \fBblend\fP, the composite operator becomes \fBover\fP.
The \fIimage\fP matte channel percent transparency is initialized to
\fIfactor\fP.  The \fIimage window\fP is initialized to \fI(100-factor)\fP.
Where factor is the value you specify in the Dialog widget.

\fBDisplace\fP shifts the image pixels as defined by a displacement map.
With this option, \fIimage\fP is used as a displacement map.  Black,
within the displacement map, is a maximum positive displacement.  White is a
maximum negative displacement and middle gray is neutral.  The displacement
is scaled to determine the pixel shift.  By default, the displacement applies
in both the horizontal and vertical directions.  However, if you specify
a \fImask\fP, \fIimage\fP is the horizontal X displacement and
\fImask\fP the vertical Y displacement.

Note that matte information for \fIimage window\fP is not retained for
colormapped X server visuals (e.g. \fIStaticColor\fP,
\fIStaticColor\fP, \fIGrayScale\fP, \fIPseudoColor\fP).  Correct
compositing behavior may require a \fITrueColor\fP or \fIDirectColor\fP
visual or a \fIStandard Colormap\fP.

Now press button 1 to select a pixel within the image window to change its
color.  Additional pixels may be recolored as prescribed by the method you
choose.  

If the Magnify widget is mapped, it can be helpful in positioning
your pointer within the image (refer to button 2).  Alternatively you
can select a pixel to recolor from within the Magnify widget.  Move the
pointer to the Magnify widget and position the pixel with the
cursor control keys.  Finally, press a button to recolor the selected
pixel (or pixels).

The actual color you request for the pixels is saved in the image.
However, the color that appears in your image window may be different.
For example, on a monochrome screen the pixel will appear black or
white even if you choose the color red as the pixel color.  However, the
image saved to a file with \fB-write\fP is written with red pixels.  To
assure the correct color text in the final image, any \fIPseudoClass\fP

Choose a matte editing method from the \fBMethod\fP sub-menu of the
Command widget.  The \fBpoint\fP method changes the matte value of the
any pixel selected with the pointer until the button is released.  The
\fBreplace\fP method changes the matte value of any pixel that matches
the color of the pixel you select with a button press.  \fBFloodfill\fP
changes the matte value of any pixel that matches the color of the pixel

Choose \fBMatte Value\fP and a dialog appears requesting a matte value.  Enter
a value between 0 and 255.  This value is assigned as the matte value of the
selected pixel or pixels.

Now, press any button to select a pixel within the image window to change
its matte value.  

If the Magnify widget is mapped, it can be helpful
in positioning your pointer within the image (refer to button 2).
Alternatively you can select a pixel to change the matte value from within the

Choose a drawing primitive from the \fBPrimitive\fP sub-menu.

Next, choose a color from the \fBColor\fP sub-menu.
Additional colors can be specified with the color browser.
You can change the menu colors by setting the X resources \fBpen1\fP
through \fBpen9\fP.  Refer to \fBX RESOURCES\fP for more details.

If you choose the color browser and press \fBGrab\fP, you can select
the primitive color by moving the pointer to the desired color on the
screen and press any button.  The transparent color updates the image
matte channel and is useful for image compositing.,

Choose a stipple, if appropriate, from the Stipple sub-menu.
Additional stipples can be specified with the file browser.
Stipples obtained from the file browser must be on disk in the
X11 bitmap format.

Choose a line width from the \fBWidth\fP sub-menu.
To choose a specific width select the Dialog widget.

Choose a point in the image window and press button 1 and hold.
Next, move the pointer to another location in the image.  As you move, a
line connects the initial location and the pointer.  When you release
the button, the image is updated with the primitive you just drew.
For polygons, the image is updated when you press and release the button
without moving the pointer.

To cancel image drawing, move the pointer back to the starting
point of the line and release the button.
.SH REGION OF INTEREST
To begin, press choose \fBRegion of Interest\fP of the \fBTransform\fP
sub-menu from the Command widget (see \fBCOMMAND WIDGET\fP).  Alternatively,
press \fBR\fP in the image window (see \fBKEYBOARD ACCELERATORS\fP).

A small window appears showing the location of the cursor in the image
window.  You are now in \fIregion of interest\fP mode.  In \fIregion of
interest\fP mode, the Command widget has these options:

.nf
    Help
    Dismiss
.fi

To define a region of interest, press button 1 and drag.  The region
of interest is defined by a highlighted rectangle that expands or contracts
as it follows the pointer.  Once you are satisfied with the region of
interest, release the button.  You are now in \fIapply\fP mode.
In \fIapply\fP mode the Command widget has these options:

You can make adjustments to the region of interest by moving the pointer to
one of the rectangle corners, pressing a button, and dragging.
Finally, choose an image processing technique from the Command widget.  You
can choose more than one image processing technique to apply to an area.
Alternatively, you can move the region of interest before applying
another image processing technique.  To exit, press \fBDismiss\fP.
.SH IMAGE PANNING
When an image exceeds the width or height of the X server screen,
\fBdisplay\fP maps a small panning icon.  The rectangle within the
panning icon shows the area that is currently displayed in the
the image window.  To \fIpan\fP about the image, press any button and drag the
pointer within the panning icon.  The pan rectangle moves with the pointer
and the image window is updated to reflect the location of the
rectangle within the panning icon.  When you have selected the area
of the image you wish to view, release the button.

Use the arrow keys to pan the image one pixel up, down, left, or right within
the image window.

The panning icon is withdrawn if the image becomes smaller than the
dimensions of the X server screen.
.SH IMAGE SEGMENTATION
Use \fB-segment\fP to segment an image by analyzing the histograms of the color
components and identifying units that are homogeneous with the fuzzy c-means
technique.  The scale-space filter analyzes the histograms of the three
color components of the image and identifies a set of classes.  The
extents of each class is used to coarsely segment the image with
thresholding.  The color associated with each class is determined by
the mean color of all pixels within the extents of a particular class.
Finally, any unclassified pixels are assigned to the closest class with
the fuzzy c-means technique.

The fuzzy c-Means algorithm can be summarized as follows:
.RS
.LP
o Build a histogram, one for each color component of the image.
.LP
o For each histogram, successively apply the scale-space filter and
build an interval tree of zero crossings in the second derivative at
each scale.  Analyze this scale-space ``fingerprint'' to determine
which peaks or valleys in the histogram are most predominant.
.LP
o The fingerprint defines intervals on the axis of the histogram.  Each
interval contains either a minima or a maxima in the original signal.
If each color component lies within the maxima interval, that pixel is
considered ``classified'' and is assigned an unique class number.
.LP
o Any pixel that fails to be classified in the above thresholding pass is
classified using the fuzzy c-Means technique.  It is assigned to one
of the classes discovered in the histogram analysis phase.
.RE

The fuzzy c-Means technique attempts to cluster a pixel by finding the local
minima of the generalized within group sum of squared error objective
function.  A pixel is assigned to the closest class of which the fuzzy
membership has a maximum value.

.SH USER PREFERENCES
Preferences affect the default behavior of \fBdisplay(1)\fP.  The preferences
are either true or false and are stored in your home directory
as \fB.displayrc\fP:
.TP
.B "display image centered on a backdrop"
This backdrop covers the entire workstation screen and is useful for
hiding other X window activity while viewing the image.   The color of
the backdrop is specified as the background color.  Refer to \fBX
RESOURCES\fP for details.
.TP
.B "confirm on program exit"
Ask for a confirmation before exiting the \fBdisplay(1)\fP program.
.TP
.B "correct image for display gamma"
If the image has a known gamma, the gamma is corrected to match that of the
X server (see the X resource \fBdisplayGamma\fP).
.TP
.B "apply Floyd/Steinberg error diffusion to image"
The basic strategy of dithering is to trade intensity resolution for
spatial resolution by averaging the intensities of several neighboring
pixels.  Images which suffer from severe contouring when reducing colors
can be improved with this preference.
.TP
.B "use a shared colormap for colormapped X visuals"
This option only applies when the default X server visual is
\fIPseudoColor\fP or \fIGrayScale\fP.  Refer to \fB-visual\fP for more
details.  By default, a shared colormap is allocated.  The image shares
colors with other X clients.  Some image colors could be approximated,
therefore your image may look very different than intended.  Choose
\fBPrivate\fP and the image colors appear exactly as they are
defined.  However, other clients may go \fItechnicolor\fP when the image
colormap is installed.
.TP
.B "display images as an X server pixmap"
Images are maintained as a XImage by default.  Set this resource to True
to utilize a server Pixmap instead.  This option is useful if your image
exceeds the dimensions of your server screen and you intend to pan the
image.  Panning is much faster with Pixmaps than with a XImage.
Pixmaps are considered a precious resource, use them with discretion.
