.SH EXAMPLES

To scale an image of a cockatoo to exactly 640 pixels in width and 480
pixels in height and position the window at location (200,200), use:

    display -geometry 640x480+200+200! cockatoo.miff

To display an image of a cockatoo without a border centered on a backdrop,
use:

    display +borderwidth -backdrop cockatoo.miff

To tile a slate texture onto the root window, use:

    display -size 1280x1024 -window root slate.png

To display a visual image directory of all your JPEG images, use:

    display 'vid:*.jpg'

To display a MAP image that is 640 pixels in width and 480 pixels in height
with 256 colors, use:

    display -size 640x480+256 cockatoo.map

To display an image of a cockatoo specified with a \fBWorld Wide Web (WWW)\fP
uniform resource locator \fB(URL)\fP, use:

    display ftp://wizards.dupont.com/images/cockatoo.jpg

To display histogram of an image, use:

    convert file.jpg HISTOGRAM:- | display -
.SH OPTIONS

Options are processed in command line order. Any option you specify on
the command line remains in effect until it is explicitly changed by specifying
the option again with a different effect. For example to display two images,
the first with 32 colors, and the second with only 16 colors, use:

      display -colors 32 cockatoo.miff -colors 16 macaw.miff

\fBDisplay\fP options can appear on the command line or in your X resources
file. See \fIX(1)\fP. Options on the command line supersede values specified
in your X resources file.
.TP
.B "-backdrop \fI<color>"\fP
\fRdisplay the image centered on a backdrop.

This backdrop covers the entire workstation screen and is useful for hiding
other X window activity while viewing the image. The color of the backdrop
is specified as the background color.
The color is specified using the format described in the "Color Names"
section of \fIX(1)\fP.
Refer to
"X Resources", below,
for details.

.TP
.B "-background \fI<color>"\fP
\fRthe background color

The color is specified using the format described in the "Color Names"
section of \fIX(1)\fP.
.TP
.B "-border \fI<width>x<height>"\fP
\fRsurround the image with a border of color

See \fB-geometry\fP for details
about the geometry specification.

.TP
.B "-bordercolor \fI<color>"\fP
\fRthe border color

The color is specified using the format described in the "Color Names"
section of \fIX(1)\fP.
.TP
.B "-borderwidth \fI<geometry>"\fP
\fRthe border width
.TP
.B "-cache \fI<threshold>"\fP
\fRmegabytes of memory available to the pixel cache

Image pixels are stored in memory until 80 megabytes of memory have been
consumed. Subsequent pixel operations are cached on disk. Operations to
memory are significantly faster but if your computer does not have a sufficient
amount of free memory you may want to adjust this threshold value.

.TP
.B "-colormap \fI<type>"\fP
\fRdefine the colormap type

Choose between \fBshared\fP or \fBprivate\fP.


This option only applies when the default X server visual is \fIPseudoColor\fP
or \fIGRAYScale\fP. Refer to \fB-visual\fP for more details. By default,
a shared colormap is allocated. The image shares colors with other X clients.
Some image colors could be approximated, therefore your image may look
very different than intended. Choose \fBPrivate\fP and the image colors
appear exactly as they are defined. However, other clients may
go \fItechnicolor\fP when the image colormap is installed.
.TP
.B "-colors \fI<value>"\fP
\fRpreferred number of colors in the image

The actual number of colors in the image may be less than your request,
but never more. Note, this is a color reduction option. Images with less
unique colors than specified with this option will have any duplicate or
unused colors removed. Refer to quantize for
more details.


Note, options \fB-dither\fP, \fB-colorspace\fP, and \fB-treedepth\fP
affect the color reduction algorithm.

.TP
.B "-colorspace \fI<value>"\fP
\fRthe type of colorspace

Choices are: \fBGRAY\fP, \fBOHTA\fP, \fBRGB\fP,
\fBTransparent\fP,
\fBXYZ\fP,
\fBYCbCr\fP, \fBYIQ\fP, \fBYPbPr\fP,
\fBYUV\fP, or \fBCMYK\fP.


Color reduction, by default, takes place in the RGB color space. Empirical
evidence suggests that distances in color spaces such as YUV or YIQ correspond
to perceptual color differences more closely than do distances in RGB space.
These color spaces may give better results when color reducing an image.
Refer to quantize for more details.


The \fBTransparent\fP color space behaves uniquely in that it preserves
the matte channel of the image if it exists.


The \fB-colors\fP or \fB-monochrome\fP option is required for this
option to take effect.

.TP
.B "-comment \fI<string>"\fP
\fRannotate an image with a comment

Use this option to assign a specific comment to the image. You can include the
image filename, type, width, height, or other image attribute by embedding
special format characters:


     %b   file size
     %c   comment
     %d   directory
     %e   filename extention
     %f   filename
     %h   height
     %i   input filename
     %k   number of unique colors
     %l   label
     %m   magick
     %n   number of scenes
     %o   output filename
     %p   page number
     %q   quantum depth
     %s   scene number
     %t   top of filename
     %u   unique temporary filename
     %w   width
     %x   x resolution
     %y   y resolution
     \\n   newline
     \\r   carriage return

For example,


     -comment "%m:%f %wx%h"

produces an image comment of \fBMIFF:bird.miff 512x480\fP for an image
titled \fBbird.miff\fP and whose width is 512 and height is 480.


If the first character of \fIstring\fP is \fI@\fP, the image comment
is read from a file titled by the remaining characters in the string.

.TP
.B "-compress \fI<type>"\fP
\fRthe type of image compression

Choices are: \fINone\fP, \fIBZip\fP, \fIFax\fP,
\fIGroup4\fP,
\fIJPEG\fP, \fILossless\fP,
\fILZW\fP, \fIRLE\fP or \fIZip\fP.


Specify \fB+compress\fP to store the binary image in an uncompressed format.
The default is the compression type of the specified image file.


If \fILZW\fP compression is specified but LZW compression has not been enabled,
the image data will be written
in an uncompressed LZW format that can be read by LZW decoders.  This
may result in larger-than-expected GIF files.

\fI"Lossless"\fP refers to lossless JPEG, which is only available if
the JPEG library has been patched to support it.
.TP
.B "-contrast"
\fRenhance or reduce the image contrast

This option enhances the intensity differences between the lighter and
darker elements of the image. Use \fB-contrast\fP to enhance
the image
or \fB+contrast\fP to reduce the image contrast.

.TP
.B "-crop \fI<width>x<height>{+-}<x offset>{+-}<y offset>{%}"\fP
\fRpreferred size and location of the cropped image

See \fB-geometry\fP for details
about the geometry specification.


The width and height give the size of the image that remains after cropping,
and the offsets give the location of the top left corner of the cropped
image with respect to the original image.  To specify the amount to be
removed, use \fB-shave\fP instead.


To specify a percentage width or height to be removed instead, append
\fB%\fP. For example
to crop the image by ten percent (five percent on each side of the image),
use \fB-crop 10%\fP.


The x and y offsets specify the location of the upper left corner of
the cropping region measured downward and rightward with respect to the
upper left corner of the image.
If the \fB-gravity\fP option is present with \fINorthEast, East,\fP
or \fISouthEast\fP
gravity, it gives the distance leftward from the right edge
of the image to the right edge of the cropping region.  Similarly, if
the \fB-gravity\fP option is present with \fISouthWest, South,\fP
or \fISouthEast\fP
gravity, the distance is measured upward between the bottom
edges.

Omit the x and y offset to generate one or more subimages of a uniform
size.

.TP
.B "-debug"
\fRenable debug printout
.TP
.B "-delay \fI<1/100ths of a second>"\fP
\fRdisplay the next image after pausing

This option is useful for regulating the animation of image sequences
\fIDelay/100\fP seconds must expire before the display
of the next image. The default is no delay between each showing of the
image sequence. The maximum delay is 65535.


You can specify a delay range (e.g. \fI-delay 10-500\fP) which sets the
minimum and maximum delay.

.TP
.B "-density \fI<width>x<height>"\fP
\fRvertical and horizontal resolution in pixels of the image

This option specifies an image density when decoding a \fIPostScript\fP
or Portable Document page. The default is 72 dots per inch in the horizontal
and vertical direction. This option is used in concert with \fB-page\fP.

.TP
.B "-depth \fI<value>"\fP
\fRdepth of the image

This is the number of bits in a color sample within a pixel. The only
acceptable values are 8 or 16.  Use this option to specify the depth of
raw images whose depth is unknown such as GRAY, RGB, or CMYK, or to change
the depth of any image after it has been read.

.TP
.B "-despeckle"
\fRreduce the speckles within an image
.TP
.B "-display \fI<host:display[.screen]>"\fP
\fRspecifies the X server to contact
.TP
.B "-dispose \fI<method>"\fP
\fRGIF disposal method

Here are the valid methods:


     0     No disposal specified.
     1     Do not dispose between frames.      
     2     Overwrite frame with background color from header.
     3     Overwrite with previous frame.
.TP
.B "-dither"
\fRapply Floyd/Steinberg error diffusion to the image

The basic strategy of dithering is to trade intensity resolution for spatial
resolution by averaging the intensities of several neighboring pixels.
Images which suffer from severe contouring when reducing colors can be
improved with this option.


The \fB-colors\fP or \fB-monochrome\fP option is required for this option
to take effect.


Use \fB+dither\fP to turn off dithering and to render Postscript without
text or graphic aliasing.

.TP
.B "-edge \fI<order>"\fP
\fRdetect edges within an image

Good order values are odd numbers from 3 to 31.

.TP
.B "-enhance"
\fRapply a digital filter to enhance a noisy image
.TP
.B "-filter \fI<type>"\fP
\fRuse this type of filter when resizing an image

Use this option to affect the resizing operation of an image (see
\fB-geometry\fP).
Choose from these filters:


     Point
     Box
     Triangle
     Hermite
     Hanning
     Hamming
     Blackman
     Gaussian
     Quadratic
     Cubic
     Catrom
     Mitchell
     Lanczos
     Bessel
     Sinc

The default filter is \fBLanczos\fP

.TP
.B "-flip"
\fRcreate a "mirror image"

reflect the scanlines in the vertical direction.

.TP
.B "-flop"
\fRcreate a "mirror image"

reflect the scanlines in the horizontal direction.

.TP
.B "-font \fI<name>"\fP
\fRuse this font when annotating the image with text

You can tag a font to specify whether it is a Postscript, Truetype, or OPTION1
font.  For example, Arial.ttf is a Truetype font, ps:helvetica
is Postscript, and x:fixed is OPTION1. 

.TP
.B "-foreground \fI<color>"\fP
\fRdefine the foreground color

The color is specified using the format described in the "Color Names"
section of \fIX(1)\fP.
.TP
.B "-frame \fI<width>x<height>+<outer bevel width>+<inner bevel width>"\fP
\fRsurround the image with an ornamental border

See \fB-geometry\fP for details
about the geometry specification.
The \fB-frame\fP option is not affected by the \fB-gravity\fP option.


The color of the border is specified with the
\fB-mattecolor\fP command
line option.

.TP
.B "-gamma \fI<value>"\fP
\fRlevel of gamma correction

The same color image displayed on two different workstations may look different
due to differences in the display monitor. Use gamma correction to adjust
for this color difference. Reasonable values extend from \fB0.8\fP to
\fB2.3\fP.


You can apply separate gamma values to the red, green, and blue channels
of the image with a gamma value list delineated with slashes
(i.e. \fB1.7\fP/\fB2.3\fP/\fB1.2\fP).


Use \fB+gamma\fP \fIvalue\fP
to set the image gamma level without actually adjusting
the image pixels. This option is useful if the image is of a known gamma
but not set as an image attribute (e.g. PNG images).

.TP
.B "-geometry \fI<width>x<height>{+-}<x offset>{+-}<y offset>{%}{@}{!}{<}{>}"\fP
\fRpreferred size and location of the Image window.

By default, the window size is the image
size and the location is chosen by you when it is mapped.


By default, the width and height are maximum values. That is, the image
is expanded or contracted to fit the width and height value while maintaining
the aspect ratio of the image. \fIAppend an exclamation point to the geometry
to force the image size to exactly the size you specify\fP. For example,
if you specify 640x480! the image width is set to 640 pixels and
height to 480.


If only the width is specified, the width assumes the
value and the height is chosen to maintain the aspect ratio of the image.
Similarly, if only the height is specified (e.g., -geometry x256),
the width is chosen to maintain the aspect ratio. 


To specify a percentage width or height instead, append %. The image size
is multiplied by the width and height percentages to obtain the final image
dimensions. To increase the size of an image, use a value greater than
100 (e.g. 125%). To decrease an image's size, use a percentage less than
100.


Use @ to specify the maximum area in pixels of an image.


Use > to change the dimensions of the image \fIonly\fP if
its size exceeds the geometry specification. < resizes the image
\fIonly\fP
if its dimensions is less than the geometry specification. For example,
if you specify '640x480>' and the image size is 512x512, the image
size does not change. However, if the image is 1024x1024, it is resized
to 640x480.  Enclose the geometry specification in quotation marks to
prevent the < or > from being interpreted by your shell
as a file redirection.


When used with \fIanimate\fP and \fIdisplay\fP, offsets are handled in
the same manner as in \fIX(1)\fP and the \fB-gravity\fP option is not used.
If the \fIx offset\fP is negative, the offset is measured leftward
from the right edge of the
screen to the right edge of the image being displayed.
Similarly, negative \fIy offset\fP is measured between the bottom edges.

.TP
.B "-help"
\fRprint usage instructions
.TP
.B "-iconGeometry \fI<geometry>"\fP
\fRspecify the icon geometry

Offsets, if present in the geometry specification, are handled in
the same manner as the \fB-geometry\fP option, using X11 style to handle
negative offsets.
.TP
.B "-iconic"
\fRiconic animation
.TP
.B "-immutable"
\fRmake image immutable
.TP
.B "-interlace \fI<type>"\fP
\fRthe type of interlacing scheme

Choices are: \fBNone, Line, Plane,\fP
or \fBPartition\fP. The default is \fBNone\fP.


This option is used to specify the type of interlacing scheme for raw image
formats such as \fBRGB\fP or \fBYUV\fP. \fBNone\fP means do not interlace
(RGBRGBRGBRGBRGBRGB...), \fBLine\fP uses scanline interlacing
(RRR...GGG...BBB...RRR...GGG...BBB...),
and \fBPlane\fP uses plane interlacing (RRRRRR...GGGGGG...BBBBBB...).
\fBPartition\fP
is like plane except the different planes are saved to individual files
(e.g. image.R, image.G, and image.B).


Use \fBLine\fP or \fBPlane\fP to create an
\fBinterlaced PNG\fP or \fB GIF\fP or
\fBprogressive JPEG\fP image.

.TP
.B "-label \fI<name>"\fP
\fRassign a label to an image

Use this option to assign a specific label to the image. Optionally you
can include the image filename, type, width, height, or other image attribute
by embedding special format character. See \fB-comment\fP for details.


For example,


     -label "%m:%f %wx%h"

produces an image label of \fBMIFF:bird.miff 512x480\fP for an image titled
\fBbird.miff\fP
and whose width is 512 and height is 480.


If the first character of \fIstring\fP is \fI@\fP, the image label is
read from a file titled by the remaining characters in the string.


When converting to \fIPostScript\fP, use this option to specify a header
string to print above the image. Specify the label font with
\fB-font\fP.

.TP
.B "-magnify \fI<factor>"\fP
\fRmagnify the image
.TP
.B "-map \fI<type>"\fP
\fR
display image using this type.
[\fIanimate\fP or \fIdisplay\fP]

Choose from these \fIStandard Colormap\fP types:

     best
     default
     gray
     red
     green
     blue

The \fIX server\fP must support the \fIStandard Colormap\fP you choose,
otherwise an error occurs. Use \fBlist\fP as the type and \fBdisplay\fP
searches the list of colormap types in \fBtop-to-bottom\fP order until
one is located. See \fIxstdcmap(1)\fP for one way of creating Standard
Colormaps.
.TP
.B "-matte"
\fRstore matte channel if the image has one

If the image does not have a matte channel, create an opaque one.


Use \fB+matte\fP to ignore the matte channel and to avoid writing a
matte channel in the output file.
.TP
.B "-mattecolor \fI<color>"\fP
\fRspecify the matte color

The color is specified using the format described in the "Color Names"
section of \fIX(1)\fP.
.TP
.B "-monochrome"
\fRtransform the image to black and white
.TP
.B "-name"
\fRname an image
.TP
.B "-negate"
\fRreplace every pixel with its complementary color

The red, green, and blue intensities of an image are negated.
White becomes black,
yellow becomes blue, etc.
Use \fB+negate\fP
to only negate the grayscale pixels of the image.

.TP
.B "-page \fI<width>x<height>{+-}<x offset>{+-}<y offset>{%}{!}{<}{>}"\fP
\fRsize and location of an image canvas

Use this option to specify the dimensions of the
\fIPostScript\fP page
in dots per inch or a TEXT page in pixels. The choices for a Postscript
page are:

For convenience you can specify the page size by media (e.g. A4, Ledger,
etc.). Otherwise, \fB-page\fP behaves much like
\fB-geometry\fP (e.g.  -page letter+43+43>).


To position a GIF image, use \fB-page\fP\fI{+-}<x offset>{+-}<y
offset>\fP (e.g. -page +100+200).


For a Postscript page, the image is sized as in \fB-geometry\fP and positioned
relative to the lower left hand corner of the page by
{+-}<\fBx\fP\fIoffset\fP>{+-}<\fBy\fP
\fIoffset>\fP. Use
-page 612x792>, for example, to center the
image within the page. If the image size exceeds the Postscript page, it
is reduced to fit the page.
The default gravity for the \fB-page\fP
option is \fISouthWest\fP, i.e., positive \fBx\fP and
\fBy\fP \fIoffset\fP are measured rightward and upward from the bottom
left corner of the page, unless the \fB-gravity\fP option is present with
a value other than \fISouthWest\fP.


The default page dimensions for a TEXT image is 612x792.


This option is used in concert with \fB-density\fP.

.TP
.B "-quality \fI<value>"\fP
\fRJPEG/MIFF/PNG compression level

For the JPEG image format, quality is 0 (worst) to 100 (best). The default
quality is 75.


Quality for the MIFF and PNG image format sets the amount of image compression
(quality / 10) and filter-type (quality % 10). Compression quality values
range from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). If filter-type is 4 or less, the specified
filter-type is used for all scanlines:


     0: none
     1: sub
     2: up
     3: average
     4: Paeth

If filter-type is 5, adaptive filtering is used when quality is greater
than 50 and the image does not have a color map, otherwise no filtering
is used.


If filter-type is 6 or more, adaptive filtering with \fIminimum-sum-of-absolute-values\fP
is used.


The default is quality is 75. Which means nearly the best compression with
adaptive filtering.


For further information, see the PNG
specification.

.TP
.B "-raise \fI<width>x<height>"\fP
\fRlighten or darken image edges

This will create a 3-D effect.
See \fB-geometry\fP for details
details about the geometry specification.
Offsets are not used.


Use \fB-raise\fP to create a raised effect, otherwise use \fB+raise\fP.

.TP
.B "-remote"
\fRperform a remote operation

The only command recognized at this time is the name of
an image file to load.

.TP
.B "-roll \fI{+-}<x offset>{+-}<y offset>"\fP
\fRroll an image vertically or horizontally

See \fB-geometry\fP for details
the geometry specification.
The offsets are not affected by the \fB-gravity\fP option.


A negative \fIx offset\fP rolls the image left-to-right. A negative \fIy
offset\fP rolls the image top-to-bottom.

.TP
.B "-rotate \fI<degrees{<}{>}>"\fP
\fRapply Paeth image rotation to the image

Use > to rotate the image only if its width exceeds the height.
< rotates the image \fIonly\fP if its width is less than the
height. For example, if you specify -rotate "-90>" and the image
size is 480x640, the image is not rotated.  However, if the
image is 640x480, it is rotated by -90 degrees.  If you use > or
<, enclose it in quotation marks to prevent it from being
misinterpreted as a file redirection.


Empty triangles left over from rotating the image are filled with the color
defined as \fBbackground\fP (class \fBbackgroundColor\fP). See \fIX(1)\fP
for details.

.TP
.B "-sample \fI<geometry>"\fP
\fRscale image with pixel sampling

See \fB-geometry\fP for details about
the geometry specification.
\fB-sample\fP ignores the \fB-filter\fP selection if the \fB-filter\fP option
is present.  Offsets, if present in the geometry string, are ignored, and
the \fB-gravity\fP option has no effect.

.TP
.B "-scene \fI<value{-value}>"\fP
\fRimage scene number or range

Use this option
.TP
.B "-segment \fI<cluster threshold>x<smoothing threshold>"\fP
\fRsegment an image

Segment an image by analyzing the histograms of the color components and
identifying units that are homogeneous with the fuzzy c-means technique.


Specify \fIcluster threshold\fP as the number of pixels in each cluster
must exceed the the cluster threshold to be considered valid. \fISmoothing
threshold\fP eliminates noise in the second derivative of the histogram.
As the value is increased, you can expect a smoother second derivative.
The default is 1.5. See
"Image Segmentation", below,
for details.

.TP
.B "-shared_memory"
\fRuse shared memory

This option specifies whether the utility should attempt use shared memory
for pixmaps.  ImageMagick must be compiled with shared memory support,
and the display must support the \fIMIT-SHM\fP extension.  Otherwise, this
option is ignored.  The default is \fBTrue\fP.

.TP
.B "-sharpen \fI<radius>x<sigma>"\fP
\fRsharpen the image

Use a gaussian operator of the given radius and
standard deviation (sigma). 

.TP
.B "-size \fI<width>x<height>{+offset}"\fP
\fRwidth and height of the image

Use this option to specify the width and height of raw images whose dimensions
are unknown such as \fBGRAY\fP,
\fBRGB\fP, or \fBCMYK\fP. In addition
to width and height, use
\fB-size\fP with an offset to skip any header information in
the image or tell the number of colors in a \fBMAP\fP image
file, (e.g. -size 640x512+256).


For Photo CD images, choose from these sizes:

     192x128
     384x256
     768x512
     1536x1024
     3072x2048

Finally, use this option to choose a particular resolution layer of a JBIG
or JPEG image (e.g. -size 1024x768).

.TP
.B "-text_font \fI<name>"\fP
\fRfont for writing fixed-width text

Specifies the name of the preferred font to use in fixed (typewriter style)
formatted text.  The default is 14 point \fICourier\fP.


You can tag a font to specify whether it is a Postscript, Truetype, or
OPTION1 font.  For example, Courier.ttf is a Truetype font
and x:fixed is OPTION1. 

.TP
.B "-texture \fI<filename>"\fP
\fRname of texture to tile onto the image background
.TP
.B "-title \fI<string>"\fP
\fRassign a title to the displayed image

Use this option to assign a specific title to the image. This is assigned
to the image window and is typically displayed in the window title bar.
Optionally you can include the image filename, type, width, height, or
other image attribute by embedding special format characters:

     %b file size
     %c comment
     %d directory
     %e filename extention
     %f filename
     %h height
     %i input filename
     %k number of unique colors
     %l label
     %m magick
     %n number of scenes
     %o output filename
     %p page number
     %q quantum depth
     %s scene number
     %t top of filename
     %u unique temporary filename
     %w width
     %x x resolution
     %y y resolution
     \\n newline
     \\r carriage return

For example,


     -title "%m:%f %wx%h"

produces an image title of MIFF:bird.miff 512x480 for an image
titled bird.miff and whose width is 512 and height is 480.

.TP
.B "-treedepth \fI<value>"\fP
\fRtree depth for the color reduction algorithm

Normally, this integer value is zero or one. A zero or one tells display
to choose an optimal tree depth for the color reduction algorithm

An optimal depth generally allows the best representation of the source
image with the fastest computational speed and the least amount of memory.
However, the default depth is inappropriate for some images. To assure
the best representation, try values between 2 and 8 for this parameter.
Refer to
quantize for more details.


The \fB-colors\fP or \fB-monochrome\fP option is required for this option
to take effect.

.TP
.B "-trim"
\fRtrim an image

This option removes any edges that are exactly the same color as the
corner pixels.  Use \fB-fuzz\fP to make \fB-trim\fP remove edges that
are nearly the same color as the corner pixels.
.TP
.B "-update \fI<seconds>"\fP
\fR
detect when image file is modified and redisplay.

Suppose that while you are displaying an image the file that is currently
displayed is over-written.
\fBdisplay\fP will automatically detect that
the input file has been changed and update the displayed image accordingly.

.TP
.B "-use_pixmap"
\fRuse the pixmap
.TP
.B "-verbose"
\fRprint detailed information about the image
.TP
.B "-visual \fI<type>"\fP
\fRanimate images using this X visual type

Choose from these visual classes:


     StaticGray
     GrayScale
     StaticColor
     PseudoColor
     TrueColor
     DirectColor
     default
     visual id

The X server must support the visual you choose, otherwise an error occurs.
If a visual is not specified, the visual class that can display the most
simultaneous colors on the default screen is chosen.

.TP
.B "-window \fI<id>"\fP
\fRmake image the background of a window

\fIid\fP can be a window id or name.  Specify \fBroot\fP to
select X's root window as the target window.


By default the image is tiled onto the background of the target
window.   If \fBbackdrop\fP or \fB-geometry\fP are
specified, the image is surrounded by the background color.  Refer to
\fBX RESOURCES\fP for details.


The image will not display on the root window if the image has more
unique colors than the target window colormap allows.  Use
\fB-colors\fP to reduce the number of colors.

.TP
.B "-window_group"
\fRspecify the window group
.TP
.B "-write"
\fRwrite the image to a file

If \fIfile\fP already exists, you will be prompted as to whether it should
be overwritten.

By default, the image is written in the format that it was read in as.
To specify a particular image format, prefix \fIfile\fP with the image
type and a colon (i.e. ps:image) or specify the image type as the filename
suffix (i.e. image.ps). See convert(1) for a list of valid image formats.
Specify file as - for standard output. If file has the
extension \fB.Z\fP or
\fB.gz\fP, the file size is \fBcompressed\fP using with compress or
\fBgzip\fP
respectively. Precede the image file name with | to pipe to a system command.
If \fIfile\fP already exists, you will be prompted as to whether it should
be overwritten.
Use \fB-compress\fP to specify the type of image compression.

The equivalent X resource for this option is
\fBwriteFilename\fP (class \fBWriteFilename\fP).
See
"X Resources", below,
for details.
.SH FILES AND FORMATS

By default, the image format is determined by its magic number. To specify
a particular image format, precede the filename
with an image format name and a colon (i.e. ps:image) or specify the image
type as the filename suffix (i.e. image.ps).
When you specify \fBX\fP as your image type, the filename has special
meaning. It specifies an X window by id, name, or
\fBroot\fP. If no filename
is specified, the window is selected by clicking the mouse in the desired
window.

Specify file as - for standard input. If file has the extension \fB.Z\fP
or \fB.gz\fP, the file is uncompressed with
\fBuncompress\fP or \fBgunzip\fP
respectively. Precede the image file name | to pipe from a system command.

Use an optional index enclosed in brackets after a file name to specify
a desired subimage of a multi-resolution image format like Photo CD (e.g.
img0001.pcd[4])
or a range for MPEG images (e.g.
video.mpg[50-75]). A subimage
specification can be disjoint (e.g. image.tiff[2,7,4]). For raw
images, specify a subimage with a geometry (e.g. -size 640x512
image.rgb[320x256+50+50]).

Single images are read with the filename you specify. Alternatively,
you can display an image sequence with a single filename. Define the range
of the image sequence with -scene. Each image in the range is read with
the filename followed by a period (.) and the scene number. You
can change this behavior by embedding a printf format specification
in the file name. For example,

    -scene 0-9 image%02d.miff

displays files image00.miff, image01.miff, through
image09.miff.
.SH MOUSE BUTTONS

The effects of each button press is described below. Three buttons are
required. If you have a two button mouse, button 1 and 3 are returned.
Press \fBALT\fP and button 3 to simulate button 2.

    Cmd-A    Press to make any image transformations permanent.
             By default, any image size transformations are
             applied to the original image to create the image
             displayed on the X server.  However, the
             transformations are not permanent (i.e. the original
             image does not change size only the X image does).
             For example, if you press ">" the X image will
             appear to double in size, but the original image
             will in fact remain the same size.  To force the
             original image to double in size, press ">" followed

.SH X RESOURCES

\fBDisplay\fP options can appear on the command line or in your X resource
file. Options on the command line supersede values specified in your X
resource file. See \fIX(1)\fP for more information on X resources.

Most \fBdisplay\fP options have a corresponding X resource. In addition,
\fBdisplay\fP
uses the following X resources:
.TP
.B "background \fI(class Background)"\fP
\fR
Specifies the preferred color to use for the Image window background. The
default is #ccc.
.TP
.B "borderColor \fI(class BorderColor)"\fP
\fR
Specifies the preferred color to use for the Image window border. The default
is #ccc.
.TP
.B "borderWidth \fI(class BorderWidth)"\fP

\fR
Specifies the gamma of the X server.
\fR
You can apply separate gamma values to the red, green, and blue channels
of the image with a gamma value list delineated with slashes (i.e. 1.7/2.3/1.2).
\fR
The default is 2.2.
.TP
.B "displayWarnings \fI(class DisplayWarnings)"\fP
\fR
\fBDisplay\fP pops up a dialog box whenever a warning message occurs.
Set this resource to False to ignore warning messages.
.TP
.B "font \fI(class FontList)"\fP
\fR
Specifies the name of the preferred font to use in normal formatted text.
The default is 14 point Helvetica.
.TP
.B "font[1-9] \fI(class Font[1-9])"\fP
\fR
Specifies the name of the preferred font to use when
annotating
the image window with text. The default fonts are fixed, variable, 5x8,
6x10, 7x13bold, 8x13bold, 9x15bold, 10x20, and 12x24.
.TP

to match the gamma of the display (see resource \fBdisplayGamma\fP). The
default is True.
.TP
.B "geometry \fI(class Geometry)"\fP
\fR
Specifies the preferred size and position of the image window. It is not
necessarily obeyed by all window managers.

Offsets, if present, are handled in \fIX(1)\fP style.  A negative x offset is
measured from the right edge of the screen to the right edge of the icon,
and a negative y offset is measured from the bottom edge of the screen
to the bottom edge of the icon.
.TP
.B "iconGeometry \fI(class IconGeometry)"\fP
\fR
Specifies the preferred size and position of the application when iconified.
It is not necessarily obeyed by all window managers.

Offsets, if present, are handled in the same manner as in class Geometry.
.TP
.B "iconic \fI(class Iconic)"\fP
\fR
This resource indicates that you would prefer that the application's windows
initially not be visible as if the windows had be immediately iconified
by you. Window managers may choose not to honor the application's request.

colors derived from this color. Default value: #697B8F.
.TP
.B "name \fI(class Name)"\fP
\fR
This resource specifies the name under which resources for the application
should be found. This resource is useful in shell aliases to distinguish
between invocations of an application, without resorting to creating links
to alter the executable file name. The default is the application name.
.TP
.B "pen[1-9] \fI(class Pen[1-9])"\fP
\fR
Specifies the color of the preferred font to use when
annotating
the image window with text. The default colors are black, blue, green,
cyan, gray, red, magenta, yellow, and white.
.TP
.B "printCommand \fI(class PrintCommand)"\fP

The image compositor requires a matte, or alpha channel in the image for
some operations. This extra channel usually defines a mask which represents
a sort of a cookie-cutter for the image. This is the case when matte is
255 (full coverage) for pixels inside the shape, zero outside, and between
zero and 255 on the boundary. If image does not have a matte channel, it
is initialized with 0 for any pixel matching in color to pixel location
(0,0), otherwise 255. See Matte Editing for a method
of defining a matte channel.

Note that matte information for image window is not retained for colormapped
X server visuals (e.g. \fIStaticColor, StaticColor, GrayScale, PseudoColor\fP).
Correct compositing behavior may require a
\fITrueColor\fP or \fIDirectColor\fP
visual or a \fIStandard Colormap\fP.

Choosing a composite operator is optional. The default operator is replace.
However, you must choose a location to composite your image and press button
1. Press and hold the button before releasing and an outline of the image
will appear to help you identify your location.

The actual colors of the pasted image is saved. However, the color that
appears in image window may be different. For example, on a monochrome
screen image window will appear black or white even though your pasted
image may have many colors. If the image is saved to a file it is written
with the correct colors. To assure the correct colors are saved in the
final image, any \fIPseudoClass\fP image is promoted to \fIDirectClass\fP.
To force a
\fIPseudoClass\fP image to remain \fIPseudoClass\fP,
use \fB-colors\fP.

background color by moving the pointer to the desired color on the screen
and press any button.

Choose a point in the image window and press this button and hold. Next,
move the pointer to another location in the image. As you move a line connects
the initial location and the pointer. When you release the button, the
degree of image rotation is determined by the slope of the line you just
drew. The slope is relative to the direction you choose from the Direction
sub-menu of the Command widget.

To cancel the image rotation, move the pointer back to the starting point
of the line and release the button.
.SH IMAGE SEGMENTATION

Choose \fBEffects->Segment\fP to segment an image by analyzing the histograms
of the color components and identifying units that are homogeneous with
the fuzzy c-means technique. The scale-space filter analyzes the histograms
of the three color components of the image and identifies a set of classes.
The extents of each class is used to coarsely segment the image with thresholding.
The color associated with each class is determined by the mean color of
all pixels within the extents of a particular class. Finally, any unclassified
pixels are assigned to the closest class with the fuzzy c-means technique.
The fuzzy c-Means algorithm can be summarized as follows:

    
Build a histogram, one for each color component of the image.
    
For each histogram, successively apply the scale-space filter and build
an interval tree of zero crossings in the second derivative at each scale.
Analyze this scale-space "fingerprint" to determine which peaks or valleys
in the histogram are most predominant.
    
The fingerprint defines intervals on the axis of the histogram. Each interval
contains either a minima or a maxima in the original signal. If each color
component lies within the maxima interval, that pixel is considered "classified"
and is assigned an unique class number.
    
Any pixel that fails to be classified in the above thresholding pass is
classified using the fuzzy c-Means technique. It is assigned to one of
the classes discovered in the histogram analysis phase.


The fuzzy c-Means technique attempts to cluster a pixel by finding the
local minima of the generalized within group sum of squared error objective
function. A pixel is assigned to the closest class of which the fuzzy membership
has a maximum value.

pointer to the \fBMagnify widget\fP and position the pixel with the cursor
control keys. Finally, press a button to recolor the selected pixel (or
pixels).

The actual color you request for the pixels is saved in the image. However,
the color that appears in your Image window may be different. For example,
on a monochrome screen the pixel will appear black or white even if you
choose the color red as the pixel color. However, the image saved to a
file with -write is written with red pixels. To assure the correct color
text in the final image, any \fIPseudoClass\fP image is promoted
to \fIDirectClass\fP
To force a \fIPseudoClass\fP image to remain
\fIPseudoClass\fP, use \fB-colors\fP.
.SH MATTE EDITING

Matte information within an image is useful for some operations such as
image compositing. This extra channel usually defines
a mask which represents a sort of a cookie-cutter for the image. This is
the case when matte is 255 (full coverage) for pixels inside the shape,
zero outside, and between zero and 255 on the boundary.

Setting the matte information in an image is done interactively. There
is no command line argument to edit a pixel. To begin, and choose \fBMatte\fP
of the \fBImage Edit\fP sub-menu from the Command widget.

Alternatively, press m in the image window.

A small window appears showing the location of the cursor in the image
window. You are now in matte edit mode. To exit immediately, press Dismiss.
In matte edit mode, the Command widget has these options:

Choose a matte editing method from the \fBMethod\fP sub-menu of the Command
widget. The \fBpoint method\fP changes the matte value of the any
pixel selected with the pointer until the button is released. The \fBreplace
method\fP changes the matte value of any pixel that matches the color
of the pixel you select with a button press. \fBFloodfill\fP changes the
matte value of any pixel that matches the color of the pixel you select
with a button press and is a neighbor. Whereas
\fBfilltoborder\fP recolors
any neighbor pixel that is not the border color. Finally \fBreset\fP changes
the entire image to the designated matte value.
Choose \fBMatte Value\fP and a dialog appears requesting a matte value.
Enter a value between \fB0 and 255\fP. This value is assigned as the matte
value of the selected pixel or pixels.
Now, press any button to select a pixel within the Image window to change
its matte value. You can change the matte value of additional pixels by
increasing the Delta value. The Delta value is first added then subtracted
from the red, green, and blue of the target color. Any pixels within the
range also have their matte value updated.
If the \fBMagnify widget\fP is mapped, it can be helpful in positioning
your pointer within the image (refer to button 2). Alternatively you can
select a pixel to change the matte value from within the
\fBMagnify widget\fP.
Move the pointer to the \fBMagnify widget\fP and position the pixel with
the cursor control keys. Finally, press a button to change the matte value
of the selected pixel (or pixels).
Matte information is only valid in a \fIDirectClass image\fP. Therefore,
any \fIPseudoClass\fP image is promoted to
\fIDirectClass\fP. Note that
matte information for \fIPseudoClass\fP is not retained for colormapped
X server visuals (e.g. \fIStaticColor, StaticColor, GrayScale, PseudoColor\fP)
unless you immediately save your image to a file (refer to Write). Correct
matte editing behavior may require a \fITrueColor\fP or \fIDirectColor\fP
visual or a \fIStandard Colormap\fP.
.SH IMAGE DRAWING

An image is drawn upon interactively. \fBThere is no command line argument
to draw on an image\fP. To begin, choose \fBDraw\fP of the Image \fBEdit\fP
sub-menu from the Command widget.
Alternatively, press d in the image window.

The cursor changes to a crosshair to indicate you are in draw mode. To
exit immediately, press Dismiss. In draw mode, the Command widget has these
options:

Choose a drawing primitive from the \fBPrimitive\fP sub-menu.

Next, choose a color from the \fBColor\fP sub-menu. Additional colors
can be specified with the color browser. You can change the menu colors
by setting the X resources pen1 through pen9. The transparent
color updates the image matte channel and is useful for image compositing.

If you choose the color browser and press \fBGrab\fP, you can select the
primitive color by moving the pointer to the desired color on the screen
and press any button. The transparent color updates the image matte channel
and is useful for image compositing.

Choose a stipple, if appropriate, from the \fBStipple\fP sub-menu. Additional
stipples can be specified with the file browser. Stipples obtained from
the file browser must be on disk in the X11 bitmap format.

Choose a line width, if appropriate, from the \fBWidth\fP sub-menu. To
choose a specific width select the \fBDialog\fP widget.

Choose a point in the image window and press button 1 and hold. Next, move
the pointer to another location in the image. As you move, a line connects
the initial location and the pointer. When you release the button, the
image is updated with the primitive you just drew. For polygons, the image
is updated when you press and release the button without moving the pointer.

To cancel image drawing, move the pointer back to the starting point of
the line and release the button.
.SH REGION OF INTEREST

To begin, press choose Region of Interest of the Pixel Transform sub-menu
from the Command widget.
Alternatively, press R in the image window.

A small window appears showing the location of the cursor in the image
window. You are now in region of interest mode. In region of interest mode,
the Command widget has these options:

To define a region of interest, press button 1 and drag. The region of
interest is defined by a highlighted rectangle that expands or contracts
as it follows the pointer. Once you are satisfied with the region of interest,
release the button. You are now in apply mode. In apply mode the Command
widget has these options:

You can make adjustments to the region of interest by moving the pointer
to one of the rectangle corners, pressing a button, and dragging. Finally,
choose an image processing technique from the Command widget. You can choose
more than one image processing technique to apply to an area. Alternatively,
you can move the region of interest before applying another image processing
technique. To exit, press Dismiss.
.SH IMAGE PANNING

When an image exceeds the width or height of the X server screen, display
maps a small panning icon. The rectangle within the panning icon shows
the area that is currently displayed in the the image window. To pan about
the image, press any button and drag the pointer within the panning icon.
The pan rectangle moves with the pointer and the image window is updated
to reflect the location of the rectangle within the panning icon. When
you have selected the area of the image you wish to view, release the button.

Use the arrow keys to pan the image one pixel up, down, left, or right
within the image window.

The panning icon is withdrawn if the image becomes smaller than the dimensions
of the X server screen.
.SH USER PREFERENCES

Preferences affect the default behavior of \fBdisplay(1)\fP. The preferences
are either true or false and are stored in your home directory
as .displayrc:
.in 15

.in 15
.B "
\fBdisplay image centered on a backdrop\fP"
.in 20
 \fR
.in 20

This backdrop covers the entire workstation screen and is useful for hiding
other X window activity while viewing the image. The color of the backdrop
is specified as the background color. Refer to X Resources
for details.
.in 15
.in 15
.B "
\fBconfirm on program exit\fP"

\fBapply Floyd/Steinberg error diffusion to image\fP"
.in 20
 \fR
.in 20

The basic strategy of dithering is to trade intensity resolution for spatial
resolution by averaging the intensities of several neighboring pixels.
Images which suffer from severe contouring when reducing colors can be
improved with this preference.
.in 15
.in 15
.B "
\fBuse a shared colormap for colormapped X visuals\fP"
.in 20
 \fR
.in 20

This option only applies when the default X server visual is
\fIPseudoColor\fP
or \fIGRAYScale\fP. Refer to \fB-visual\fP for more details. By default,
a shared colormap is allocated. The image shares colors with other X clients.
Some image colors could be approximated, therefore your image may look
very different than intended. Otherwise the image colors appear exactly
as they are defined. However, other clients may go technicolor when the
image colormap is installed.
.in 15
.in 15
.B "
\fBdisplay images as an X server pixmap\fP"
.in 20
 \fR
.in 20

Images are maintained as a XImage by default. Set this resource to True
to utilize a server Pixmap instead. This option is useful if your image
exceeds the dimensions of your server screen and you intend to pan the
image. Panning is much faster with Pixmaps than with a XImage. Pixmaps
are considered a precious resource, use them with discretion.
