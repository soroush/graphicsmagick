Note, a format delineated with \fB+\fP means that if more than one image is
specified, it is composited into a single multi-image file.  Use
\fB+adjoin\fP if you want a single image produced for each frame.

Raw images are expected to have one byte per pixel unless \fBImageMagick\fP
is compiled in 16-bit mode.  Here, the raw data is expected to be stored
two bytes per pixel in most-significant-byte-first order.
You can tell if
\fBImageMagick\fP was compiled in 16-bit mode by typing "convert" without any
options, and looking for "Q:16" in the first line of output.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B "-adjoin
join images into a single multi-image file.

By default, all images of an image sequence are stored in the same
file.  However, some formats (e.g. JPEG) do not support more than one image
and are saved to separate files.  Use \fB+adjoin\fP to force this behavior.
.TP
.B "-antialias
remove pixel aliasing.
.TP
.B "-append
append an image sequence.  

All the input images must have the same width or height.  Images of the
same width are stacked top-to-bottom.  Images of the same height are
stacked left-to-right.  Use \fB+append\fP to stack rectangular images
left-to-right.
.TP
.B "-average"
averages an image sequence.
.TP
.B "-background \fIcolor\fP"
the background color.
.TP
.B "-blur \fI<radius>x<sigma>\fP"
blur the image with a Gaussian operator of the given radius and
standard deviation (sigma).
.TP
.B "-border \fI<width>x<height>\fP"
surround the image with a border of color.  See \fBX(1)\fP for details
about the geometry specification.
.TP
.B "-bordercolor \fIcolor\fP"
the border color.
.TP
.B "-box \fIcolor\fP"
set the color of the annotation bounding box.  See \fB-draw\fP or
for further details.

See \fBX(1)\fP for details about the color specification.
.TP
.B "-cache \fIthreshold\fP"
megabytes of memory available to the pixel cache.

Image pixels are stored in memory until 80 megabytes of memory
have been consumed.  Subsequent pixel operations are cached on disk.
Operations to memory are significantly faster but if your computer does not
have a sufficient amount of free memory you may want to adjust this threshold
value.
.TP
.B "-channel \fItype\fP"
the type of channel: \fBRed\fP, \fBGreen\fP, \fBBlue\fP, 
\fBOpacity\fP, \fBCyan\fP, \fBYellow\fP, \fBMagenta\fP, or 
\fBlack\fP.

Use this option to extract a particular \fIchannel\fP from the image.
\fBMatte\fP, for example, is useful for extracting the opacity values
from an image.
.TP
.B "-charcoal \fIradius\fP"
simulate a charcoal drawing.
.TP
.B "-chop \fI<width>x<height>{\+-}<x offset>{\+-}<y offset>{%}\fP"
remove pixels from the image interior.
.TP
.B "-coalesce"
merge a sequence of images.
.TP
.B "-colorize \fIvalue\fP"
colorize the image with the fill color.

Specify the amount of colorization as a percentage.  You can apply separate
colorization values to the red, green, and blue channels of the image with a
colorization value list delineated with slashes (e.g. 0/0/50).
.TP
.B "-colors \fIvalue\fP"
preferred number of colors in the image.

The actual number of colors in the image may be less than your request,
but never more.  Note, this is a color reduction option.  Images with
less unique colors than specified with this option will have any duplicate
or unused colors removed.
Refer to \fBquantize(5)\fP for more details.

Note, options \fB-dither\fP, \fB-colorspace\fP, and \fB-treedepth\fP affect
the color reduction algorithm.
.TP
.B "-colorspace \fIvalue\fP"
the type of colorspace: \fBGRAY\fP, \fBOHTA\fP, \fBRGB\fP,
\fBTransparent\fP, \fBXYZ\fP, \fBYCbCr\fP, \fBYIQ\fP, \fBYPbPr\fP, \fBYUV\fP,
or \fBCMYK\fP.
Color reduction, by default, takes place in the RGB color space.
Empirical evidence suggests that distances in color spaces such as YUV
or YIQ correspond to perceptual color differences more closely
than do distances in RGB space.  These color spaces may give better
results when color reducing an image.  Refer to \fBquantize(5)\fP for
more details.

The \fBTransparent\fP color space behaves uniquely in that it preserves
the matte channel of the image if it exists.

The \fB-colors\fP or \fB-monochrome\fP option is required for this option
to take effect.
.TP
.B "-comment \fIstring\fP"
annotate an image with a comment.

Use this option to assign a specific comment to the image.  You can
include the image filename, type, width, height, or other image
attributes by embedding special format characters:

.nf
    %b   file size
    %c   comment
    %d   directory
    %e   filename extention
    %f   filename
    %h   height
    %i   input filename
    %k   number of unique colors
    %l   label
    %m   magick
    %n   number of scenes
    %o   output filename
    %p   page number
    %q   quantum depth
    %s   scene number
    %t   top of filename
    %u   unique temporary filename
    %w   width
    %x   x resolution
    %y   y resolution
    \\n   newline
    \\r   carriage return
.fi

For example,

.nf
     -comment "%m:%f %wx%h"
.fi

produces an image comment of \fBMIFF:bird.miff 512x480\fP for an image
titled \fBbird.miff\fP and whose width is 512 and height is 480.

If the first character of \fIstring\fP is \fB@\fP, the image comment is read
from a file titled by the remaining characters in the string.
.TP
.B "-compress \fItype\fP"
the type of image compression: \fINone\fP, \fIBZip\fP, \fIFax\fP, \fIGroup4\fP,
\fIJPEG\fP, \fILZW\fP, \fIRLE\fP, or \fIZip\fP.

Specify \fB\+compress\fP to store the binary image in an uncompressed format.
The default is the compression type of the specified image file.
.TP
.B "-contrast"
enhance or reduce the image contrast.

This option enhances the intensity differences between the
lighter and darker elements of the image.  Use \fB-contrast\fP to
enhance the image or \fB+contrast\fP to reduce the image contrast.
.TP
.B "-crop \fI<width>x<height>{\+-}<x offset>{\+-}<y offset>{%}\fP"
preferred size and location of the cropped image.  See \fBX(1)\fP for details
about the geometry specification.

To specify a percentage width or height instead, append \fB%\fP.  For example
to crop the image by ten percent on all sides of the image, use
\fB-crop 10%\fP.

Omit the x and y offset to generate one or more subimages of a uniform size.

Use cropping to crop a particular area of an image.   Use \fB-crop
0x0\fP to trim edges that are the background color.  Add an x and y offset
to leave a portion of the trimmed edges with the image.
.TP
.B "-cycle \fIamount\fP"
displace image colormap by amount.

\fIAmount\fP defines the number of positions each colormap entry is shifted.
.TP
.B "-deconstruct"
break down an image sequence into constituent parts.
.TP
.B "-delay \fI<1/100ths of a second>\fP"
display the next image after pausing.

This option is useful for regulating the animation of a sequence of
GIF images within Netscape.  \fI1/100ths of a second\fP must expire
before the redisplay of the image sequence.  The default is no delay
between each showing of the image sequence.

You can specify a delay range (e.g. -delay 10-500) which sets the
minimum and maximum delay.
.TP
.B "-density \fI<width>x<height>\fP
vertical and horizontal resolution in pixels of the image.

This option specifies an image density when decoding a Postscript or
Portable Document page.  The default is 72 pixels per inch in the horizontal
and vertical direction.  This option is used in concert with \fB-page\fP.
.TP
.B "-depth \fIvalue\fP"
depth of the image. This is the number of bits in a pixel. The only acceptable
values are 8 or 16.  Use this option to specify the depth of raw images whose
depth is unknown such as \fBGRAY\fP, \fBRGB\fP, or \fBCMYK\fP,
or to change the depth of any image after it has been read.
.TP
.B "-despeckle"
reduce the speckles within an image.
.TP
.B "-display \fIhost:display[.screen]\fP"
specifies the X server to contact; see \fBX(1)\fP.
.TP
.B "-dispose \fImethod\fP"
GIF disposal method.

Here are the valid methods:

.nf
     0	No disposal specified.
     1	Do not dispose between frames.
     2	Overwrite frame with background color from header.
     3	Overwrite with previous frame.
.fi
.TP
.B "-dither"
apply Floyd/Steinberg error diffusion to the image.

The basic strategy of dithering is to trade intensity resolution for
spatial resolution by averaging the intensities of several neighboring
pixels.  Images which suffer from severe contouring when reducing colors
can be improved with this option.

The \fB-colors\fP or \fB-monochrome\fP option is required for this option
to take effect.

Use \fB+dither\fP to render Postscript without text or graphic aliasing.
.TP
.B "-draw \fIstring\fP"
annotate an image with one or more graphic primitives.

Use this option to annotate an image with one or more graphic primitives.
The primitives include

.nf
     point
     line
     rectangle
     roundRectangle
     arc
     ellipse
     circle
     polyline
     polygon
     bezier
     path
     color
     matte
     text
     image
.fi

\fBPoint\fP, \fBline\fP, \fBcolor\fP, \fBmatte\fP, \fBtext\fP, and
\fBimage\fP each require a single coordinate.  \fBLine\fP requires a
start and end coordinate, while \fBrectangle\fP expects an upper left
and lower right coordinate.  \fBCircle\fP has a center coordinate and a
coordinate on the outer edge.  Use \fBArc\fP to circumscribe an arc within
a rectangle.  Arcs require a start and end point as well as the degree of
rotation (e.g. 130,30 200,100 45,90). Use \fBEllipse\fP to draw a partial
ellipse centered at the given point with the x-axis and y-axis radius and
start and end of arc in degrees (e.g. 100,100 100,150 0,360).  Finally,
\fBpolyline\fP and \fBpolygon\fP require three or more coordinates to define
its boundaries.  Coordinates are
integers separated by an optional comma.  For example, to define a circle
centered at 100,100 that extends to 150,150 use:

.nf
     -draw 'circle 100,100 150,150'
.fi

Paths represent an outline of an object which is defined in terms of
moveto (set a new current point), lineto (draw a straight line),
curveto (draw a curve using a cubic bezier), arc (elliptical or
circular arc) and closepath (close the current shape by drawing a line
to the last moveto) elements. Compound paths (i.e., a path with
subpaths, each consisting of a single moveto followed by one or more
line or curve operations) are possible to allow effects such as "donut
holes" in objects.

Use \fBcolor\fP to change the color of a pixel.  Follow the
pixel coordinate with a method:

.nf
     point
     replace
     floodfill
     filltoborder
     reset
.fi

Consider the target pixel as that specified by your coordinate.  The
\fBpoint\fP method recolors the target pixel.  The \fBreplace\fP method
recolors any pixel that matches the color of the target pixel.
\fBFloodfill\fP recolors any pixel that matches the color of the target
pixel and is a neighbor,  whereas \fBfilltoborder\fP recolors any neighbor
pixel that is not the border color. Finally, \fBreset\fP recolors all pixels.

Use \fBmatte\fP to the change the pixel matte value to transparent.
Follow the pixel coordinate with a method (see the \fBcolor\fP
primitive for a description of methods).  The \fBpoint\fP method
changes the matte value of the target pixel.  The \fBreplace\fP method
changes the matte value of any pixel that matches the color of the
target pixel.  \fBFloodfill\fP changes the matte value of any pixel
that matches the color of the target pixel and is a neighbor, whereas
\fBfilltoborder\fP changes the matte value of any neighbor pixel that is not the
border color (\fB-bordercolor\fP).  Finally \fBreset\fP changes the matte
value of all pixels.

Use \fBtext\fP to annotate an image with text.  Follow the text
coordinates with a string.  If the string has embedded spaces, enclose
it in double quotes.  Optionally you can include the image filename,
type, width, height, or other image attribute by embedding special format
characters.  See \fB-comment\fP for details.

For example,

.nf
     -draw 'text 100,100 "%m:%f %wx%h"'
.fi

annotates the image with \fBMIFF:bird.miff 512x480\fP for an image
titled \fBbird.miff\fP and whose width is 512 and height is 480.

Use \fBimage\fP to composite an image with another image. Follow the
image primitive with a composite operator, image position, image size,
and filename:

.nf
     -draw 'image Over 100,100 225,225 image.jpg'
.fi

If the first character of \fIstring\fP is \fB@\fP, the text is read
from a file titled by the remaining characters in the string.

You can set the primitive color, font color, and font bounding box color with
\fB-fill\fP, \fB-font\fP, and \fB-box\fP respectively.  Options are
processed in command line order so be sure to use \fB-fill\fP
\fIbefore\fP the \fB-draw\fP option.
.TP
.B "-edge \fI<radius>\fP"
enhance the edges of the image with a convolution filter of the given radius.
.TP
.B "-emboss \fI<radius>x<sigma>\fP"
emboss the image with a convolution kernel of the given radius
and standard deviation (sigma).
.TP
.B "-enhance"
apply a digital filter to enhance a noisy image.
.TP
.B "-equalize"
perform histogram equalization to the image.
.TP
.B "-fill \fIcolor\fP"
color to use when filling a graphic primitive.  See \fB-draw\fP for further
details.
.TP
.B "-filter \fItype\fP"
use this type of filter when resizing an image.

Use this option to affect the resizing operation of an image (see
\fB-geometry\fP).  Choose from these filters:

.nf
     Point
     Box
     Triangle
     Hermite
     Hanning
     Hamming
     Blackman
     Gaussian
     Quadratic
     Cubic
     Catrom
     Mitchell
     Lanczos
     Bessel
     Sinc
.fi

The default filter is \fBLanczos\fP.

.TP
.B "-flatten"
flatten a sequence of images.
.TP
.B "-flip"
create a "mirror image" by reflecting the image scanlines in the vertical
direction.
.TP
.B "-flop"
create a "mirror image" by reflecting the image scanlines in the horizontal
direction.
.TP
.B "-font \fIname\fP"
use this font when annotating the image with text.

If the font is a fully qualified X server font name, the font is obtained
from an X server (e.g. -*-helvetica-medium-r-*-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-*).  To
use a TrueType font, precede the TrueType filename with a \fB@\fP (e.g.
@times.ttf).  Otherwise, specify a Postscript, X11, or TrueType font (e.g. helvetica).
.TP
.B "-frame \fI<width>x<height>+<outer bevel width>+<inner bevel width>\fP"
surround the image with an ornamental border.  See \fBX(1)\fP for details
about the geometry specification.

The color of the border is specified with the \fB-mattecolor\fP command line
option.
.TP
.B "-fuzz \fIdistance\fP"
colors within this distance are considered equal.

A number of algorithms search for a target color.  By default the color
must be exact.  Use this option to match colors that are close to the
target color in RGB space.  For example, if you want to automatically trim the
edges of an image with \fB-crop 0x0\fP but the image was scanned.  The
target background color may differ by a small amount.  This option can
account for these differences.
.TP
.B "-gamma \fIvalue\fP"
level of gamma correction.

The same color image displayed on two different workstations may look
different due to differences in the display monitor.  Use gamma
correction to adjust for this color difference.  Reasonable values
extend from 0.8 to 2.3.

You can apply separate gamma values to the red, green, and blue
channels of the image with a gamma value list delineated with slashes
(e.g. 1.7/2.3/1.2).

Use \fB+gamma\fP to set the image gamma level without actually adjusting
the image pixels.  This option is useful if the image is of a known
gamma but not set as an image attribute (e.g. PNG images).
.TP
.B "-gaussian \fI<radius>x<sigma>\fP"
blur the image with a Gaussian operator of the given radius and
standard deviation (sigma).
.TP
.B "-geometry \fI<width>x<height>{\+-}<x offset>{\+-}<y offset>{%}{@}{!}{<}{>}\fP"
preferred size or location of the image when encoding.

By default, the width and height are maximum values.  That is, the
image is expanded or contracted to fit the width and height value while
maintaining the aspect ratio of the image.  Append an exclamation point
to the geometry to force the image size to exactly the size you
specify.  For example, if you specify \fB640x480!\fP the image width is
set to 640 pixels and height to 480.  If only one factor is
specified, both the width and height assume the value.

To specify a percentage width or height instead, append \fB%\fP.  The
image size is multiplied by the width and height percentages to obtain
the final image dimensions.  To increase the size of an image, use a
value greater than 100 (e.g. 125%).  To decrease an image's size, use a
percentage less than 100.

Use \fB@\fP to specify the maximum area in pixels of an image.

Use \fB>\fP to change the dimensions of the image \fIonly\fP
if its size exceeds the geometry specification.  \fB<\fP resizes
the image \fIonly\fP if its dimensions is less than the geometry
specification.  For example, if you specify \fB'640x480>'\fP and the
image size is 512x512, the image size does not change.  However, if
the image is 1024x1024, it is resized to 640x480.

There are 72 pixels per inch in Postscript coordinates.
.TP
.B "-gravity \fItype\fP"
direction text gravitates to when annotating the image: NorthWest, North,
NorthEast, West, Center, East, SouthWest, South, SouthEast.
See \fBX(1)\fP for details about the gravity specification.

The direction you choose specifies where to
position the text when annotating the image.  For example \fICenter\fP gravity
forces the text to be centered within the image.
By default, the text gravity is \fINorthWest\fP.
.TP
.B "-implode \fIamount\fP"
implode image pixels about the center.
.TP
.B "-intent \fItype\fP"
use this type of rendering intent when managing the image color.

Use this option to affect the color management operation of an image (see
\fB-profile\fP).  Choose from these intents:

.nf
     Absolute
     Perceptual
     Relative
     Saturation
.fi

The default rendering intent is undefined.

.TP
.B "-interlace \fItype\fP"
the type of interlacing scheme: \fBNone\fP, \fBLine\fP, \fBPlane\fP, or
\fBPartition\fP.  The default is \fBNone\fP.

This option is used to specify the type of interlacing scheme for raw
image formats such as \fBRGB\fP or \fBYUV\fP.  \fBNo\fP means do not
interlace (RGBRGBRGBRGBRGBRGB...), \fBLine\fP uses scanline
interlacing (RRR...GGG...BBB...RRR...GGG...BBB...), and \fBPlane\fP uses
plane interlacing (RRRRRR...GGGGGG...BBBBBB...).  \fBPartition\fP is like
plane except the different planes are saved to individual files (e.g.
image.R, image.G, and image.B).

Use \fBLine\fP, or \fBPlane\fP to create an interlaced GIF or progressive
JPEG image.
.TP
.B "-label \fIname\fP"
assign a label to an image.

Use this option to assign a specific label to the image.  Optionally
you can include the image filename, type, width, height, or scene
number in the label by embedding special format characters.   
See \fB-comment\fP for details.

For example,

.nf
     -label "%m:%f %wx%h"
.fi

produces an image label of \fBMIFF:bird.miff 512x480\fP for an image
titled \fBbird.miff\fP and whose width is 512 and height is 480.

If the first character of \fIstring\fP is \fB@\fP, the image label is read
from a file titled by the remaining characters in the string.

When converting to Postscript, use this option to specify a header string
to print above the image.  Specify the label font with \fB-font\fP.
.TP
.B "-level \fIvalue\fP"
adjust the level of image contrast

Give three point values delineated with slashes: black, mid, and white
(e.g. 10/1.0/65000).  The white and black points range from 0 to MaxRGB
and mid ranges from 0 to 10.
.TP
.B "-list \fItype\fP"
the type of list: \fBColor\fP, \fBDelegate\fP, \fBFormat\fP, \fBMagic\fP,
\fBModule\fP, or \fBType\fP.

This option lists entries from the ImageMagick configuration files.
.TP
.B "-loop \fIiterations\fP"
add Netscape loop extension to your GIF animation.

A value other than zero forces the animation to repeat itself up to
\fIiterations\fP times.
.TP
.B "-map \fIfilename\fP"
choose a particular set of colors from this image.

By default, color reduction chooses an optimal set of colors that
best represent the original image.  Alternatively, you can choose a
particular set of colors from an image file with this option.  Use
\fB+map\fP to reduce all images provided on the command line to a single
optimal set of colors that best represent all the images.
.TP
.B "-matte"
store matte channel if the image has one otherwise create an opaque one.
.TP
.B "-median \fIradius\fP"
apply a median filter to the image.
.TP
.B "-modulate \fIvalue\fP"
vary the brightness, saturation, and hue of an image.

Specify the percent change in brightness, the color saturation, and the color
hue separated by commas.  For example, to increase the color brightness
by 20% and decrease the color saturation by 10% and leave the hue unchanged,
use: \fB-modulate 120,90\fP.
.TP
.B "-monochrome"
transform the image to black and white.
.TP
.B "-morph"
morphs an image sequence.

Both the image pixels and size are linearly interpolated to give the
appearance of a meta-morphosis from one image to the next.
.TP
.B "-mosaic"
create an mosaic from an image sequence.
.TP
.B "-negate"
replace every pixel with its complementary color (white becomes black, yellow
becomes blue, etc.).

The red, green, and blue intensities of an image are negated.  Use
\fB+negate\fP to only negate the grayscale pixels of the image.
.TP
.B "-noise \fIradius\fP"
add or reduce the noise in an image.

The principal function of noise peak elimination filter is to smooth
the objects within an image without losing edge information and without
creating undesired structures.  The central idea of the algorithm is to
replace a pixel with its next neighbor in value within a pixel window,
if this pixel has been found to be noise.  A pixel is defined as noise
if and only if this pixel is a maximum or minimum within the pixel window.
Use \fIradius\fP to specify the width of the neighborhood.

Use \fB+noise\fP followed by a noise type to add noise to an image.  Choose
from these noise types:

.nf
    Uniform
    Gaussian
    Multiplicative
    Impulse
    Laplacian
    Poisson
.fi
.TP
.B "-normalize"
transform image to span the full range of color values.

This is a contrast enhancement technique.
.TP
.B "-opaque \fIcolor\fP"
change this color to the fill color within the image.  See \fB-fill\fP for
more details.
.TP
.B "-page \fI<width>x<height>{\+-}<x offset>{\+-}<y offset>{%}{!}{<}{>}\fP"
preferred size and location of an image canvas.

Use this option to specify the dimensions of the Postscript page in
dots per inch or a TEXT page in pixels.  The choices for a Postscript page are:

.nf

For convenience you can specify the page size by media (e.g.
A4, Ledger, etc.).  Otherwise, \fB-page\fP behaves much like \fB-geometry\fP
(e.g. -page letter+43+43>).

To position a GIF image, use -page \fI{\+-}<x offset>{\+-}<y offset>\fP
(e.g. -page +100+200).

For a Postscript page, the image is sized as in \fB-geometry\fP and
positioned relative to the lower left hand corner of the page by
\fI{\+-}<x offset>{\+-}<y offset>\fP.  Use -page 612x792>, for example,
to center the image within the page.  If the image size exceeds the
Postscript page, it is reduced to fit the page.

The default page dimensions for a TEXT image is 612x792.

This option is used in concert with \fB-density\fP.
.TP
.B "-paint \fIradius\fP"
simulate an oil painting.

Each pixel is replaced by the most frequent color in a circular neighborhood
whose width is specified with \fIradius\fP.
.TP
.B "-ping
efficiently determine image characteristics.
.TP
.B "-pointsize \fIvalue\fP"
pointsize of the Postscript, X11, or TrueType font.
.TP
.B "-preview \fItype\fP"
image preview type.

Use this option to affect the preview operation of an image
(e.g. convert -preview Gamma Preview:gamma.gif).
Choose from these previews:

.nf
     Rotate
     Shear
     Roll
     Hue
     Saturation
     Brightness
     Gamma
     Spiff
     Dull
     Grayscale
     Quantize
     Despeckle
     ReduceNoise
     AddNoise
     Sharpen
     Blur
     Threshold
     Edge Detect

     Raise
     Segment
     Solarize
     Swirl
     Implode
     Wave
     OilPaint
     CharcoalDrawing
     JPEG
.fi

The default preview is \fBJPEG\fP.
.TP
.B "-profile \fIfilename\fP"
add ICM color or IPTC newswire information profile to image.

Use \fB+profile icm\fP or \fB+profile iptc\fP to remove the respective
profile.
.TP
.B "-quality \fIvalue\fP"
JPEG/MIFF/PNG compression level.

For the JPEG image format, quality is 0 (worst) to 100 (best).  The default
quality is 75.

Quality for the MIFF and PNG image format sets the amount of image compression
(quality / 10) and filter-type (quality % 10).  Compression quality
values range from 0 (worst) to 100 (best).  If filter-type is 4
or less, the specified filter-type is used for all scanlines:

.nf
    0: none
    1: sub
    2: up
    3: average
    4: Paeth
.fi

If filter-type is 5, adaptive filtering is used when quality
is greater than 50 and the image does not have a color map,
otherwise no filtering is used.

If filter-type is 6 or more, adaptive filtering with
\fIminimum-sum-of-absolute-values\fP is used.

The default is quality is 75.  Which means nearly the best compression
with adaptive filtering.

For further information, see the PNG specification (RFC 2083),
<http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/TR>.
.TP
.B "-raise \fI<width>x<height>\fP"
lighten or darken image edges to create a 3-D effect.    See \fBX(1)\fP for
details about the geometry specification.

Use \fB-raise\fP to create a raised effect, otherwise use \fB+raise\fP.
.TP
.B "-region \fI<width>x<height>{\+-}<x offset>{\+-}<y offset>\fP"
apply options to a portion of the image.

By default, any command line options are applied to the entire image.  Use
\fB-region\fP to restrict operations to a particular area of the image.
.TP
.B "-roll \fI{\+-}<x offset>{\+-}<y offset>\fP"
roll an image vertically or horizontally.  See \fBX(1)\fP for details
about the geometry specification.

A negative \fIx offset\fP rolls the image left-to-right.  A negative
\fIy offset\fP rolls the image top-to-bottom.
.TP
.B "-rotate \fIdegrees{<}{>}\fP"
apply Paeth image rotation to the image.

Use \fB>\fP to rotate the image \fIonly\fP if its width exceeds the
height.  \fB<\fP rotates the image \fIonly\fP if its width is less than
the height.  For example, if you specify \fB-90>\fP and the image size
is 480x640, the image is not rotated by the specified angle.  However,
if the image is 640x480, it is rotated by -90 degrees.

Empty triangles left over from rotating the image are filled with
the color defined as \fBbackground\fP (class \fBbackgroundColor\fP).
See \fBX(1)\fP for details.
.TP
.B "-sample \fIgeometry\fP"
scale image with pixel sampling.
.TP
.B "-scale \fIgeometry\fP"
scale image.
.TP
.B "-scene \fIvalue\fP"
image scene number.
.TP
.B "-seed \fIvalue\fP"
pseudo-random number generator seed value.
.TP
.B "-segment \fI<cluster threshold>x<smoothing threshold>\fP"
segment an image by analyzing the histograms of the color components and
identifying units that are homogeneous with the fuzzy c-means technique.

Specify \fIcluster threshold\fP as the number of pixels in each cluster must
exceed the the cluster threshold to be considered valid.  \fISmoothing
threshold\fP eliminates noise in the second derivative of the
histogram.  As the value is increased, you can expect a smoother second
derivative.  The default is 1.5.  See \fBIMAGE SEGMENTATION\fP for
details.
.TP
.B "-shade \fI<azimuth>x<elevation>\fP"
shade the image using a distant light source.

Specify \fIazimuth\fP and \fIelevation\fP as the position of the light source.
Use \fB+shade\fP to return the shading results as a grayscale image.
.TP
.B "-sharpen \fI<radius>x<sigma>\fP"
sharpen the image with a Laplacian operator of the given radius and
standard deviation (sigma).
.TP
.B "-shave \fI<width>x<height>\fP"
shave pixels from the image edges.
.TP
.B "-shear \fI<x degrees>x<y degrees>\fP"
shear the image along the X or Y axis by a positive or negative shear angle.

Shearing slides one edge of an image along the X or Y axis, creating a
parallelogram.  An X direction shear slides an edge along the X axis,
while a Y direction shear slides an edge along the Y axis.  The amount
of the shear is controlled by a shear angle.  For X direction shears,
\fIx degrees\fP is measured relative to the Y axis, and similarly, for
Y direction shears \fIy degrees\fP is measured relative to the X axis.

Empty triangles left over from shearing the image are filled with
the color defined as \fBbackground\fP (class \fBbackgroundColor\fP).
See \fBX(1)\fP for details.
.TP
.B "-size \fI<width>x<height>+<offset>\fP"
width and height of the image.

Use this option to specify the width and height of raw images whose
dimensions are unknown such as \fBGRAY\fP, \fBRGB\fP, or \fBCMYK\fP.
In addition to width and height, use \fB-size\fP to skip any header
information in the image or tell the number of colors in a \fBMAP\fP
image file, (e.g. -size 640x512+256).

For Photo CD images, choose from these sizes:

.nf
      192x128
      384x256
      768x512
     1536x1024
     3072x2048
.fi

Finally, use this option to choose a particular resolution layer of a JBIG
or JPEG image (e.g. -size 1024x768).
.TP
.B "-solarize \fIfactor\fP"
negate all pixels above the threshold level.  Specify \fIfactor\fP as the
percent threshold of the intensity (0 - 99.9%).

This option produces a \fBsolarization\fP effect seen when exposing
a photographic film to light during the development process.
.TP
.B "-spread \fIamount\fP"
displace image pixels by a random amount.

\fIAmount\fP defines the size of the neighborhood around each pixel to
choose a candidate pixel to swap.
.TP
.B "-stroke \fIcolor\fP"
color to use when stoking a graphic primitive.  See \fB-draw\fP for further
details.
.TP
.B "-strokewidth \fIvalue\fP"
set the stroke width.  See \fB-draw\fP for further details.
.TP
.B "-swirl \fIdegrees\fP"
swirl image pixels about the center.

\fIDegrees\fP defines the tightness of the swirl.
.TP
.B "-texture \fIfilename\fP"
name of texture to tile onto the image background.
.TP
.B "-threshold \fIvalue\fP"
threshold the image.

Create a bi-level image such that any pixel intensity that
is equal or exceeds the threshold is reassigned the maximum intensity otherwise
the minimum intensity.
.TP
.B "-tile \fIfilename\fP"
tile image when filling a graphic primitive.
.TP
.B "-transparent \fIcolor\fP"
make this color transparent within the image.
.TP
.B "-treedepth \fIvalue\fP"
Normally, this integer value is zero or one.  A zero or one tells
\fBconvert\fP to choose a optimal tree depth for the color reduction
algorithm.

An optimal depth generally allows the best representation of the source
image with the fastest computational speed and the least amount of
memory.  However, the default depth is inappropriate for some images.
To assure the best representation, try values between 2 and 8 for this
parameter.  Refer to \fBquantize(5)\fP for more details.

The \fB-colors\fP option is required for this option to take effect.
.TP
.B "-type \fItype\fP"
set the image type:
\fBBilevel\fP, \fBGrayscale\fP, \fBPalette\fP,
\fBPaletteMatte\fP, \fBTrueColor\fP, \fBTrueColorMatte\fP,
\fBColorSeparation\fP, \fBColorSeparationMatte\fP, or \fBOptimize\fP.
.TP
.B "-units \fItype\fP"
the type of image resolution: \fBUndefined\fP, \fBPixelsPerInch\fP, or
\fBPixelsPerCentimeter\fP.  The default is \fBUndefined\fP.
.TP
.B "-unsharp \fI<radius>x<sigma>\fP"
sharpen the image with a unsharp mask operator of the given radius and
standard deviation (sigma).
.TP
.B -verbose
print detailed information about the image.

This information is printed: image scene number;  image name;  converted
image name;  image size;  the image class (\fIDirectClass\fP or
\fIPseudoClass\fP);  the total number of unique colors;  and the number
of seconds to read and transform the image.
.TP
.B "-view \fIstring\fP"
FlashPix viewing parameters.
.TP
.B "-wave \fI<amplitude>x<wavelength>\fP"
alter an image along a sine wave.

Specify \fIamplitude\fP and \fIwavelength\fP to effect the characteristics of
the wave.
.PP
Options are processed in command line order.
Any option you specify on the command line remains in effect until it is
explicitly changed by specifying the option again with a different effect.
Some options only effect the decoding of images and others only the encoding.

By default, the image format is determined by its magic number. To
specify a particular image format, precede the filename with an image
format name and a colon (i.e. ps:image) or specify the image type as
the filename suffix (i.e. image.ps).  See \fBDESCRIPTION\fP for a list
of valid formats.

When you specify \fBX\fP as your image type, the filename has special
meaning.  It specifies an X window by id, name, or \fBroot\fP.  If no
filename is specified, the window is selected by clicking the mouse in
the desired window.

Specify \fIinput_file\fP as \fI-\fP for standard input,
\fIoutput_file\fP as \fI-\fP for standard output.  If \fIinput_file\fP
has the extension \fB.Z\fP or \fB.gz\fP, the file is uncompressed with
\fBuncompress\fP or \fBgunzip\fP respectively.  If \fIoutput_file\fP
has the extension \fB.Z\fP or \fB.gz\fP, the file size is compressed
using with \fBcompress\fP or \fBgzip\fP respectively.  Finally, precede
the image file name with \fI|\fP to pipe to or from a system command.

Use an optional index enclosed in brackets after a file name to specify
a desired subimage of a multi-resolution image format like Photo CD
(e.g. img0001.pcd[4]) or a range for MPEG images (e.g. video.mpg[50-75]).
A subimage specification can be disjoint (e.g. image.tiff[2,7,4]).
For raw images, specify a subimage with a geometry (e.g. -depth 8 -size
640x512 image.rgb[320x256+50+50]).

Single images are written with the filename you specify.  However,
multi-part images (e.g. a multi-page Postscript document with \fB+adjoin\fP
specified) are written with the filename followed by a period (\fB.\fP) and
the scene number.  You can change this behavior by embedding a \fBprintf\fP
format specification in the file name.  For example,

.nf
     image%02d.miff
.fi

converts files image00.miff, image01.miff, etc.

The % character is always interpreted in output filenames. To get a %
character in the filename, use %%.

Prepend an at sign (\fB@\fP) to a filename to read a list of image
filenames from that file.  This is convenient in the event you have too
many image filenames to fit on the command line.
.SH IMAGE SEGMENTATION
Use \fB-segment\fP to segment an image by analyzing the histograms of the color
components and identifying units that are homogeneous with the fuzzy c-means
technique.  The scale-space filter analyzes the histograms of the three
color components of the image and identifies a set of classes.  The
extents of each class is used to coarsely segment the image with
thresholding.  The color associated with each class is determined by
the mean color of all pixels within the extents of a particular class.
Finally, any unclassified pixels are assigned to the closest class with
the fuzzy c-means technique.

The fuzzy c-Means algorithm can be summarized as follows:
.RS
.LP
o Build a histogram, one for each color component of the image.
.LP
o For each histogram, successively apply the scale-space filter and
build an interval tree of zero crossings in the second derivative at
each scale.  Analyze this scale-space ``fingerprint'' to determine
which peaks or valleys in the histogram are most predominant.
.LP
o The fingerprint defines intervals on the axis of the histogram.  Each
interval contains either a minima or a maxima in the original signal.
If each color component lies within the maxima interval, that pixel is
considered ``classified'' and is assigned an unique class number.
.LP
o Any pixel that fails to be classified in the above thresholding pass is
classified using the fuzzy c-Means technique.  It is assigned to one
of the classes discovered in the histogram analysis phase.
.RE

The fuzzy c-Means technique attempts to cluster a pixel by finding the local
minima of the generalized within group sum of squared error objective
function.  A pixel is assigned to the closest class of which the fuzzy
membership has a maximum value.
