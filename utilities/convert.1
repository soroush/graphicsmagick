README
tells where to find this software\fP.

Note, a format delineated with + means that if more than one
image is specified, it is composited into a single multi-image file. Use
\fB+adjoin\fP
if you want a single image produced for each frame.

Raw images are expected to have one byte per pixel unless \fBImageMagick\fP
is compiled in 16-bit mode. Here, the raw data is expected to be stored
two bytes per pixel in most-significant-byte-first order.
You can tell if \fBImageMagick\fP was compiled in 16-bit mode by typing
"convert" without any options, and looking for "Q:16" in the first line of
output.

.SH OPTIONS

Options are processed in command line order. Any option you specify on
the command line remains in effect until it is explicitly changed by specifying
the option again with a different effect.
.TP
.B "-adjoin"
\fRjoin images into a single multi-image file

By default, all images of an image sequence are stored in the same
file. However, some formats (e.g. JPEG) do not support more than one image
and are saved to separate files. Use \fB+adjoin\fP to force this
behavior.

.TP
.B "-affine \fImatrix"\fP
\fRdrawing transform matrix
.TP
.B "-antialias"
\fRremove pixel aliasing
.TP
.B "-append"
\fRappend a set of images

All the input images must have the same width or height. Images of the
same width are stacked top-to-bottom. Images with the same height are stacked
left-to-right. Use \fB+append\fP to stack images of the same
width and the same height top-to-bottom.

.TP
.B "-average"
\fRaverage a set of images
.TP
.B "-background \fIcolor"\fP
\fRthe background color
.TP
.B "-blur \fI<radius>x<sigma>"\fP
\fRblur the image with a gaussian operator

Blur with the given radius and
standard deviation (sigma).

.TP
.B "-border \fI<width>x<height>"\fP
\fRsurround the image with a border of color

See \fIX(1)\fP for details
about the geometry specification.

.TP
.B "-bordercolor \fIcolor"\fP
\fRthe border color
.TP
.B "-box \fIcolor"\fP
\fRset the color of the annotation bounding box

See \fB-draw\fP for further
details.

.TP
.B "-cache \fIthreshold"\fP
\fRmegabytes of memory available to the pixel cache

Image pixels are stored in memory until 80 megabytes of memory have been
consumed. Subsequent pixel operations are cached on disk. Operations to
memory are significantly faster but if your computer does not have a sufficient
amount of free memory you may want to adjust this threshold value.

.TP
.B "-channel \fItype"\fP
\fRthe type of channel

Choose from: \fBRed\fP, \fBGreen\fP, \fBBlue\fP, \fBOpacity\fP,
\fBCyan\fP, \fBMagenta\fP, \fBYellow\fP, or \fBBlack\fP.


Use this option to extract a particular \fIchannel\fP from the image.
\fBMatte\fP,
for example, is useful for extracting the opacity values from an image.

.TP
.B "-charcoal \fIfactor"\fP
\fRsimulate a charcoal drawing
.TP
.B "-chop \fI<width>x<height>{+-}<x offset>{+-}<y offset>{%}"\fP
\fRremove pixels from the interior of an image

The width and height give the number of columns and rows to remove,
and the offsets give the location of the leftmost column and topmost
row to remove.


The \fB-chop\fP option removes entire rows and columns,
and moves the remaining corner blocks leftward and upward to close the gaps.

.TP
.B "-clip"
\fRapply the clipping path, if one is present

If a clipping path is present, it will be applied to subsequent operations.

For example, if you type the following command:

    convert -clip -negate cockatoo.tif negated_cockatoo.tif

only the pixels within the clipping path are negated.
.TP
.B "-coalesce"
\fRmerge a sequence of images

See \fBX(1)\fP for details about the color specification

.TP
.B "-colorize \fIvalue"\fP
\fRcolorize the image with the pen color

Specify the amount of colorization as a percentage. You can apply separate
colorization values to the red, green, and blue channels of the image with
a colorization value list delineated with slashes (e.g. 0/0/50).

.TP
.B "-colors \fIvalue"\fP
\fRpreferred number of colors in the image

The actual number of colors in the image may be less than your request,
but never more. Note, this is a color reduction option. Images with less
unique colors than specified with this option will have any duplicate or
unused colors removed. Refer to quantize for
more details.


Note, options \fB-dither\fP, \fB-colorspace\fP, and \fB-treedepth\fP
affect the color reduction algorithm.

.TP
.B "-colorspace \fIvalue"\fP
\fRthe type of colorspace

Choices are: \fBGRAY\fP, \fBOHTA\fP, \fBRGB\fP,
\fBTransparent\fP,
\fBXYZ\fP,
\fBYCbCr\fP, \fBYIQ\fP, \fBYPbPr\fP,
\fBYUV\fP, or \fBCMYK\fP.


Color reduction, by default, takes place in the RGB color space. Empirical
evidence suggests that distances in color spaces such as YUV or YIQ correspond
to perceptual color differences more closely than do distances in RGB space.
These color spaces may give better results when color reducing an image.
Refer to quantize for more details.


The \fBTransparent\fP color space behaves uniquely in that it preserves
the matte channel of the image if it exists.


The \fB-colors\fP or \fB-monochrome\fP option is required for this
option to take effect.

.TP
.B "-comment \fIstring"\fP
\fRannotate an image with a comment

Use this option to assign a specific comment to the image. You can include the
image filename, type, width, height, or other image attribute by embedding
special format characters:


     %b   file size
     %c   comment
     %d   directory
     %e   filename extention
     %f   filename
     %h   height
     %i   input filename
     %k   number of unique colors
     %l   label
     %m   magick
     %n   number of scenes
     %o   output filename
     %p   page number
     %q   quantum depth
     %s   scene number
     %t   top of filename
     %u   unique temporary filename
     %w   width
     %x   x resolution
     %y   y resolution
     \\n   newline
     \\r   carriage return

For example,


     -comment "%m:%f %wx%h"

produces an image comment of \fBMIFF:bird.miff 512x480\fP for an image
titled \fBbird.miff\fP and whose width is 512 and height is 480.


If the first character of \fIstring\fP is \fI@\fP, the image comment
is read from a file titled by the remaining characters in the string.

.TP
.B "-compose \fIoperator"\fP
\fRthe type of image composition
[This option is not used by \fIconvert\fP but this section
is included because it describes the composite operators that are used
by the \fI-draw\fP option of \fIconvert\fP.]


By default, each of the composite image pixels are replaced by the
corresponding image tile pixel. You can choose an alternate composite
operation:


     Over
     In
     Out
     Atop
     Xor
     Plus
     Minus
     Add
     Subtract
     Difference
     Multiply
     Bumpmap
     Copy
     CopyRed
     CopyGreen
     CopyBlue
     CopyOpacity

How each operator behaves is described below.

.in 15

.in 15
.B "Over"
.in 20
 \fR
.in 20

The result will be the union of the two image shapes, with opaque areas of
\fIcomposite image\fP obscuring \fIimage\fP in the region of overlap.

.in 15
.in 15
.B "In"
.in 20
 \fR
.in 20

The result is simply \fIcomposite image\fP cut by the shape
of \fIimage\fP.
None of the image data of \fIimage\fP will be in the result.

.in 15
.in 15
.B "Out"
.in 20
 \fR
.in 20

The resulting image is \fIcomposite image\fP with the shape
of \fIimage\fP cut out.

.in 15
.in 15
.B "Atop"
.in 20
 \fR
.in 20

The result is the same shape as image \fIimage\fP,
with \fIcomposite image\fP
obscuring \fIimage\fP where the image shapes overlap.  Note this differs
from \fBover\fP because the portion of \fIcomposite image\fP outside
\fIimage\fP's shape does not appear in the result.

.in 15
.in 15
.B "Xor"
.in 20
 \fR
.in 20

The result is the image data from both \fIcomposite image\fP and
\fIimage\fP
that is outside the overlap region.  The overlap region will be blank.

.in 15
.in 15
.B "Plus"
.in 20
 \fR
.in 20

The result is just the sum of the image data.  Output values are
cropped to 255 (no overflow).  This operation is independent of the
matte channels.

.in 15
.in 15
.B "Minus"
.in 20
 \fR
.in 20

The result of \fIcomposite image\fP - \fIimage\fP, with underflow
cropped to
zero.  The matte channel is ignored (set to 255, full coverage).

.in 15
.in 15
.B "Add"
.in 20
 \fR
.in 20

The result of \fIcomposite image\fP + \fIimage\fP, with overflow wrapping
around (\fImod\fP 256).

.in 15
.in 15
.B "Subtract"
.in 20
 \fR
.in 20

The result of \fIcomposite image\fP - \fIimage\fP, with underflow wrapping
around (\fImod\fP 256).  The \fBadd\fP and \fBsubtract\fP operators can be
used to perform reversible transformations.

.in 15
.in 15
.B "Difference"
.in 20
 \fR
.in 20

The result of abs(\fIcomposite image\fP - \fIimage\fP).  This is useful
for comparing two very similar images.

.in 15
.in 15
.B "Multiply"
.in 20
 \fR
.in 20

The result of \fIcomposite image\fP * \fIimage\fP.  This is useful for
the creation of drop-shadows.

.in 15
.in 15
.B "Bumpmap"
.in 20
 \fR
.in 20

The result \fIimage\fP shaded by \fIcomposite image\fP.

The resulting image is \fIimage\fP replaced with \fIcomposite image\fP.
Here the matte information is ignored.

.in 15
.in 15
.B "CopyRed"
.in 20
 \fR
.in 20

The resulting image is the red layer in \fIimage\fP replaced with the red
layer in \fIcomposite image\fP.  The other layers are copied untouched.

.in 15
.in 15
.B "CopyGreen"
.in 20
 \fR
.in 20

The resulting image is the green layer in \fIimage\fP replaced with the green
layer in \fIcomposite image\fP.  The other layers are copied untouched.

.in 15
.in 15
.B "CopyBlue"
.in 20
 \fR
.in 20

The resulting image is the blue layer in \fIimage\fP replaced with the blue
layer in \fIcomposite image\fP.  The other layers are copied untouched.

.in 15
.in 15
.B "CopyOpacity"
.in 20
 \fR
.in 20

The resulting image is the matte layer in \fIimage\fP replaced with the matte
layer in \fIcomposite image\fP.  The other layers are copied untouched.

.in 15


The image compositor requires a matte, or alpha channel in the image
for some operations.  This extra channel usually defines a mask which
represents a sort of a cookie-cutter for the image.  This is the case
when matte is 255 (full coverage) for pixels inside the shape, zero
outside, and between zero and 255 on the boundary.  For certain
operations, if \fIimage\fP does not have a matte channel, it is initialized
with 0 for any pixel matching in color to pixel location (0,0), otherwise
255 (to work properly \fBborderwidth\fP must be 0).

.TP
.B "-compress \fItype"\fP
\fRthe type of image compression

Choices are: \fINone\fP, \fIBZip\fP, \fIFax\fP,
\fIGroup4\fP,
\fIJPEG\fP,
\fILZW\fP, \fIRLE\fP or \fIZip\fP.


Specify \fB+compress\fP to store the binary image in an uncompressed format.
The default is the compression type of the specified image file.

.TP
.B "-contrast"
\fRenhance or reduce the image contrast

This option enhances the intensity differences between the lighter and
darker elements of the image. Use \fB-contrast\fP to enhance
the image
or \fB+contrast\fP to reduce the image contrast.

.TP
.B "-crop \fI<width>x<height>{+-}<x offset>{+-}<y offset>{%}"\fP
\fRpreferred size and location of the cropped image

See \fIX(1)\fP for details
about the geometry specification.


The width and height give the size of the image that remains after cropping,
and the offsets give the location of the top left corner of the cropped
image with respect to the original image.  To specify the amount to be
removed, use \fB-shave\fP instead.


To specify a percentage width or height to be removed instead, append
\fB%\fP. For example
to crop the image by ten percent (five percent on each side of the image),
use \fB-crop 10%\fP.


Use cropping to apply image processing options to, or display, a particular
area of an image.


Omit the x and y offset to generate one or more subimages of a uniform
size.


Use cropping to crop a particular area of an image. Use \fB-crop 0x0\fP
to trim edges that are the background color. Add an x and y offset to leave
a portion of the trimmed edges with the image.

.TP
.B "-cycle \fIamount"\fP
\fRdisplace image colormap by amount

\fIAmount\fP defines the number of positions each colormap entry is
shifted.

.TP
.B "-debug"
\fRenable debug printout
.TP
.B "-deconstruct"
\fRbreak down an image sequence into constituent parts
.TP
.B "-delay \fI<1/100ths of a second>"\fP
\fRdisplay the next image after pausing

This option is useful for regulating the animation of image sequences
\fIDelay/100\fP seconds must expire before the display
of the next image. The default is no delay between each showing of the
image sequence. The maximum delay is 65535.


You can specify a delay range (e.g. \fI-delay 10-500\fP) which sets the
minimum and maximum delay.

.TP
.B "-density \fI<width>x<height>"\fP
\fRvertical and horizontal resolution in pixels of the image

This option specifies an image density when decoding a \fIPostScript\fP
or Portable Document page. The default is 72 dots per inch in the horizontal
and vertical direction. This option is used in concert with \fB-page\fP.

.TP
.B "-depth \fIvalue"\fP
\fRdepth of the image

This is the number of bits in a pixel. The only acceptable
values are 8 or 16.  Use this option to specify the depth of raw images whose
depth is unknown such as GRAY, RGB, or CMYK, or to change the depth of any
image after it has been read.

.TP
.B "-despeckle"
\fRreduce the speckles within an image
.TP
.B "-display \fIhost:display[.screen]"\fP
\fRspecifies the X server to contact

This option is used with convert for
obtaining image or font from this X server.  See \fIX(1)\fP.

.TP
.B "-dispose \fImethod"\fP
\fRGIF disposal method

Here are the valid methods:


     0     No disposal specified.
     1     Do not dispose between frames.      
     2     Overwrite frame with background color from header.
     3     Overwrite with previous frame.
.TP
.B "-dissolve \fIvalue"\fP
\fRdissolve an image
.TP
.B "-dither"
\fRapply Floyd/Steinberg error diffusion to the image

The basic strategy of dithering is to trade intensity resolution for spatial
resolution by averaging the intensities of several neighboring pixels.
Images which suffer from severe contouring when reducing colors can be
improved with this option.


The \fB-colors\fP or \fB-monochrome\fP option is required for this option
to take effect.


Use \fB+dither\fP to turn off dithering and to render Postscript without
text or graphic aliasing.

.TP
.B "-draw \fIstring"\fP
\fRannotate an image with one or more graphic primitives

Use this option to annotate an image with one or more graphic primitives.
The primitives include


     point           x,y
     line            x0,y0 x1,y1
     rectangle       x0,y0 x1,y1
     roundRectangle  x0,y0  w,h  wc,hc
     arc             x0,y0 x1,y1 a0,a1
     ellipse         x0,y0 rx,ry a0,a1
     circle          x0,y0 x1,y1
     polyline        x0,y0  ...  xn,yn
     polygon         x0,y0  ...  xn,yn
     bezier          x0,y0  ...  xn,yn
     path            path specification
     color           x0,y0 method
     matte           x0,y0 method
     text            x0,y0 string
     image           operator x0,y0 w,h filename

\fBPoint\fP requires a single coordinate.
\fBLine\fP requires a start and end coordinate, while
\fBrectangle\fP
expects an upper left and lower right coordinate.
\fBroundRectangle\fP has a center coordinate, a width and
height, and the width and height of the corners.
\fBCircle\fP has a center coordinate and a coordinate for
the outer edge.  Use \fBArc\fP to circumscribe an arc within
a rectangle.  Arcs require a start and end point as well as the degree
of rotation (e.g. 130,30 200,100 45,90).
Use \fBEllipse\fP to draw a partial ellipse
centered at the given point with the x-axis and y-axis radius
and start and end of arc in degrees (e.g. 100,100 100,150 0,360).
Finally, \fBpolyline\fP and \fBpolygon\fP require
three or more coordinates to define its boundaries.
Coordinates are integers separated by an optional comma.  For example,
to define a circle centered at 100,100
that extends to 150,150 use:


     -draw 'circle 100,100 150,150'

See Paths.
Paths
represent an outline of an object which is defined in terms of
moveto (set a new current point), lineto (draw a straight line),
curveto (draw a curve using a cubic bezier), arc (elliptical or
circular arc) and closepath (close the current shape by drawing a line
to the last moveto) elements. Compound paths (i.e., a path with
subpaths, each consisting of a single moveto followed by one or more
line or curve operations) are possible to allow effects such as "donut
holes" in objects.


Use \fBcolor\fP to change the color of a pixel. Follow the pixel coordinate
with a method:


     point
     replace
     floodfill
     filltoborder
     reset

Consider the target pixel as that specified by your coordinate. The
\fBpoint\fP
method recolors the target pixel. The \fBreplace\fP method recolors any
pixel that matches the color of the target pixel.
\fBFloodfill\fP recolors
any pixel that matches the color of the target pixel and is a neighbor,
whereas \fBfilltoborder\fP recolors any neighbor pixel that is not the
border color. Finally, \fBreset\fP recolors all pixels.


Use \fBmatte\fP to the change the pixel matte value to transparent. Follow
the pixel coordinate with a method (see the \fBcolor\fP primitive for
a description of methods). The \fBpoint\fP method changes the matte value
of the target pixel. The \fBreplace\fP method changes the matte value
of any pixel that matches the color of the target pixel. \fBFloodfill\fP
changes the matte value of any pixel that matches the color of the target
pixel and is a neighbor, whereas
\fBfilltoborder\fP changes the matte
value of any neighbor pixel that is not the border color (\fB-bordercolor\fP).
Finally \fBreset\fP changes the matte value of all pixels.


Use \fBtext\fP to annotate an image with text. Follow the text coordinates
with a string. If the string has embedded spaces, enclose it in double
quotes. Optionally you can include the image filename, type, width, height,
or other image attribute by embedding special format character.
See \fB-comment\fP for details.


For example,


     -draw 'text 100,100 "%m:%f %wx%h"'

annotates the image with MIFF:bird.miff 512x480 for an image titled
bird.miff
and whose width is 512 and height is 480.


Use \fBimage\fP to composite an image with another image. Follow the
image keyword with the composite operator, image location, image size,
and filename:


     -draw 'image Over 100,100 225,225 image.jpg'

See \fB-compose\fP for a description of the composite operators.


If the first character of \fIstring\fP is \fI@\fP, the text is read from
a file titled by the remaining characters in the string.


You can set the primitive color, font color, and font bounding box
color with
\fB-fill\fP, \fB-font\fP, and \fB-box\fP respectively. Options
are processed in command line order so be sure to use \fB-fill\fP \fIbefore\fP
the \fB-draw\fP option.

.TP
.B "-edge \fIorder"\fP
\fRdetect edges within an image

Good order values are odd numbers from 3 to 31.

.TP
.B "-emboss"
\fRemboss an image
.TP
.B "-enhance"
\fRapply a digital filter to enhance a noisy image
.TP
.B "-equalize"
\fRperform histogram equalization to the image
.TP
.B "-fill \fIcolor"\fP
\fRcolor to use when filling a graphic primitive

See \fB-draw\fP for further
details.

.TP
.B "-filter \fItype"\fP
\fRuse this type of filter when resizing an image

Use this option to affect the resizing operation of an image (see
\fB-geometry\fP).
Choose from these filters:


     Point
     Box
     Triangle
     Hermite
     Hanning
     Hamming
     Blackman
     Gaussian
     Quadratic
     Cubic
     Catrom
     Mitchell
     Lanczos
     Bessel
     Sinc

The default filter is \fBLanczos\fP

.TP
.B "-flatten"
\fRflatten a sequence of images
.TP
.B "-flip"
\fRcreate a "mirror image"

reflect the scanlines in the vertical direction.

.TP
.B "-flop"
\fRcreate a "mirror image"

reflect the scanlines in the horizontal direction.

.TP
.B "-font \fIname"\fP
\fRuse this font when annotating the image with text

You can tag a font to specify whether it is a Postscript, Truetype, or OPTION1
font.  For example, Arial.ttf is a Truetype font, ps:helvetica
is Postscript, and x:fixed is OPTION1. 

.TP
.B "-frame \fI<width>x<height>+<outer bevel width>+<inner bevel width>"\fP
\fRsurround the image with an ornamental border

See \fIX(1)\fP for details
about the geometry specification.


The color of the border is specified with the
\fB-mattecolor\fP command
line option.

.TP
.B "-fuzz \fIdistance{%}"\fP
\fRcolors within this distance are considered equal

A number of algorithms search for a target color. By default the color
must be exact. Use this option to match colors that are close to the target
color in RGB space. For example, if you want to automatically trim the
edges of an image with \fI-crop 0x0\fP but the image was scanned and the
target background color may differ by a small amount. This option can account
for these differences.


The \fIdistance\fP can be in absolute intensity units or, by appending
\fI"%"\fP, as a percentage of the maximum possible intensity (255 or 65535).

.TP
.B "-gamma \fIvalue"\fP
\fRlevel of gamma correction

The same color image displayed on two different workstations may look different
due to differences in the display monitor. Use gamma correction to adjust
for this color difference. Reasonable values extend from \fB0.8\fP to
\fB2.3\fP.


You can apply separate gamma values to the red, green, and blue channels
of the image with a gamma value list delineated with slashes
(i.e. \fB1.7\fP/\fB2.3\fP/\fB1.2\fP).


Use \fB+gamma\fP \fIvalue\fP
to set the image gamma level without actually adjusting
the image pixels. This option is useful if the image is of a known gamma
but not set as an image attribute (e.g. PNG images).

.TP
.B "-gaussian \fI<radius>x<sigma>"\fP
\fRblur the image with a gaussian operator

Use the given radius and standard deviation (sigma). 

.TP
.B "-geometry \fI<width>x<height>{+-}<x offset>{+-}<y offset>{%}{@}{!}{<}{>}"\fP
\fRpreferred size and location of the Image window.

See \fIX(1)\fP for details
about the geometry specification. By default, the window size is the image
size and the location is chosen by you when it is mapped.


By default, the width and height are maximum values. That is, the image
is expanded or contracted to fit the width and height value while maintaining
the aspect ratio of the image. \fIAppend an exclamation point to the geometry
to force the image size to exactly the size you specify\fP. For example,
if you specify \fB640x480!\fP the image width is set to 640 pixels and
height to 480. If only one factor is specified, both the width and height
assume the value.


To specify a percentage width or height instead, append %. The image size
is multiplied by the width and height percentages to obtain the final image
dimensions. To increase the size of an image, use a value greater than
100 (e.g. 125%). To decrease an image's size, use a percentage less than
100.


Use \fB@\fP to specify the maximum area in pixels of an image.


Use \fB>\fP to change the dimensions of the image \fIonly\fP if
its size exceeds the geometry specification. \fB<\fP resizes the image
\fIonly\fP
if its dimensions is less than the geometry specification. For example,
if you specify \fB'640x480>'\fP and the image size is 512x512, the image
size does not change. However, if the image is 1024x1024, it is resized
to 640x480.


There are 72 pixels per inch in PostScript coordinates.


When used as a \fBmontage\fP option, \fB-geometry\fP gives the image
size and border size
for each tile; default is 256x256+0+0.  In \fBcomposite\fP, \fB-geometry\fP
gives the dimensions of the composite image and its location with respect
to the main image.

.TP
.B "-gravity \fItype"\fP
\fRdirection text gravitates to when annotating the image.

Choices are: NorthWest, North,
NorthEast, West, Center, East, SouthWest, South, SouthEast. See X(1) for
details about the gravity specification.


The direction you choose specifies where to position the text when annotating
the image. For example \fICenter\fP gravity forces the text to be centered
within the image. By default, the image gravity is \fINorthWest\fP.

.TP
.B "-help"
\fRprint usage instructions
.TP
.B "-implode \fIfactor"\fP
\fRimplode image pixels about the center
.TP
.B "-intent \fItype"\fP
\fRuse this type of rendering intent when managing the image color

Use this option to affect the the color management operation of an image (see
\fB-profile\fP).
Choose from these intents:
\fBAbsolute, Perceptual, Relative, Saturation\fP 


The default intent is undefined.

.TP
.B "-interlace \fItype"\fP
\fRthe type of interlacing scheme

Choices are: \fBNone, Line, Plane,\fP
or \fBPartition\fP. The default is \fBNone\fP.


This option is used to specify the type of interlacing scheme for raw image
formats such as \fBRGB\fP or \fBYUV\fP. \fBNone\fP means do not interlace
(RGBRGBRGBRGBRGBRGB...), \fBLine\fP uses scanline interlacing
(RRR...GGG...BBB...RRR...GGG...BBB...),
and \fBPlane\fP uses plane interlacing (RRRRRR...GGGGGG...BBBBBB...).
\fBPartition\fP
is like plane except the different planes are saved to individual files
(e.g. image.R, image.G, and image.B).


Use \fBLine\fP or \fBPlane\fP to create an
\fBinterlaced PNG\fP or \fB GIF\fP or
\fBprogressive JPEG\fP image.

.TP
.B "-label \fIname"\fP
\fRassign a label to an image

Use this option to assign a specific label to the image. Optionally you
can include the image filename, type, width, height, or other image attribute
by embedding special format character. See \fB-comment\fP for details.


For example,


     -label "%m:%f %wx%h"

produces an image label of \fBMIFF:bird.miff 512x480\fP for an image titled
\fBbird.miff\fP
and whose width is 512 and height is 480.


If the first character of \fIstring\fP is \fI@\fP, the image label is
read from a file titled by the remaining characters in the string.


When converting to \fIPostScript\fP, use this option to specify a header
string to print above the image. Specify the label font with
\fB-font\fP.

.TP
.B "-level \fIvalue"\fP
\fRadjust the level of image contrast

Give three point values delineated with commas: black, mid, and white
(e.g. 10,1.0,65000).  The white and black points range from 0 to MaxRGB
and mid ranges from 0 to 10.

.TP
.B "-list \fItype"\fP
\fRthe type of list

Choices are: \fBDelegate\fP, \fBFormat\fP, \fBMagic\fP,
\fBModules\fP, or \fBType\fP.


This option lists entries from the ImageMagick configuration files.

.TP
.B "-loop \fIiterations"\fP
\fRadd Netscape loop extension to your GIF animation

A value other than zero forces the animation to repeat itself up to
\fIiterations\fP
times.

.TP
.B "-map \fIfilename"\fP
\fRchoose a particular set of colors from this image
[convert or mogrify]

By default, color reduction chooses an optimal set of colors that best
represent the original image. Alternatively, you can choose a particular
set of colors from an image file with this option. Use
\fB+map\fP to reduce
all images provided on the command line to a single optimal set of colors
that best represent all the images.

.TP
.B "-matte"
\fRstore matte channel if the image has one

If the image does not have a matte channel, create an opaque one.

.TP
.B "-median \fIorder"\fP
\fRapply a median filter to the image

Good order values are odd numbers from 3 to 31

.TP
.B "-modulate \fIvalue"\fP
\fRvary the brightness, saturation, and hue of an image

Specify the percent change in brightness, the color saturation, and the
hue separated by commas. For example, to increase the color brightness
by 20% and decrease the color saturation by 10% and leave the hue unchanged,
use: \fB-modulate 120,90\fP.

.TP
.B "-monochrome"
\fRtransform the image to black and white
.TP
.B "-morph \fIframes"\fP
\fRmorphs an image sequence

Both the image pixels and size are linearly interpolated to give the appearance
of a meta-morphosis from one image to the next.

.TP
.B "-mosaic"
\fRcreate a mosaic from an image sequence
.TP
.B "-negate"
\fRreplace every pixel with its complementary color

The red, green, and blue intensities of an image are negated.
White becomes black,
yellow becomes blue, etc.
Use \fB+negate\fP
to only negate the grayscale pixels of the image.

.TP
.B "-noise \fIvalue"\fP
\fRadd or reduce noise in an image

The principal function of noise peak elimination filter is to smooth the
objects within an image without losing edge information and without creating
undesired structures. The central idea of the algorithm is to replace a
pixel with its next neighbor in value within a pixel window, if this pixel
has been found to be noise. A pixel is defined as noise if and only if
this pixel is a maximum or minimum within the pixel window.


Use \fBorder\fP to specify the width of the neighborhood.


Use \fB+noise\fP followed by a noise type to add noise to an image. Choose
from these noise types:


     Uniform
     Gaussian
     Multiplicative
     Impulse
     Laplacian
     Poisson
.TP
.B "-noop"
\fRNOOP (does nothing)
.TP
.B "-normalize"
\fRtransform image to span the full range of color values

This is a contrast enhancement technique.

.TP
.B "-opaque \fIcolor"\fP
\fRchange this color to the pen color within the image

See \fB-fill\fP for more details.

.TP
.B "-page \fI<width>x<height>{+-}<x offset>{+-}<y offset>{%}{!}{<}{>}"\fP
\fRsize and location of an image canvas

Use this option to specify the dimensions of the
\fIPostScript\fP page
in dots per inch or a TEXT page in pixels. The choices for a Postscript
page are:

For convenience you can specify the page size by media (e.g. A4, Ledger,
etc.). Otherwise, \fB-page\fP behaves much like
\fB-geometry\fP (e.g.
-page
letter+43+43>).


To position a GIF image, use \fB-page\fP\fI{+-}<x offset>{+-}<y
offset>\fP (e.g. -page +100+200).


For a Postscript page, the image is sized as in \fB-geometry\fP and positioned
relative to the lower left hand corner of the page by
{+-}<\fBx\fP\fIoffset\fP>{+-}<\fBy\fP
\fIoffset>\fP. Use
-page 612x792>, for example, to center the
image within the page. If the image size exceeds the Postscript page, it
is reduced to fit the page.


The default page dimensions for a TEXT image is 612x792.


This option is used in concert with \fB-density\fP.

.TP

The default preview is \fBJPEG\fP.

.TP
.B "-process"
\fRprocess an image
.TP
.B "-profile \fIfilename"\fP
\fRadd ICM color or IPTC newswire information profile to image

Use +profile icm or +profile iptc to remove the respective
profile.

.TP
.B "-quality \fIvalue"\fP
\fRJPEG/MIFF/PNG compression level

For the JPEG image format, quality is 0 (worst) to 100 (best). The default
quality is 75.


Quality for the MIFF and PNG image format sets the amount of image compression
(quality / 10) and filter-type (quality % 10). Compression quality values
range from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). If filter-type is 4 or less, the specified
filter-type is used for all scanlines:


     0: none
     1: sub
     2: up
     3: average
     4: Paeth

If filter-type is 5, adaptive filtering is used when quality is greater
than 50 and the image does not have a color map, otherwise no filtering
is used.


If filter-type is 6 or more, adaptive filtering with \fIminimum-sum-of-absolute-values\fP
is used.


The default is quality is 75. Which means nearly the best compression with
adaptive filtering.


For further information, see the PNG
specification.

.TP
.B "-raise \fI<width>x<height>"\fP
\fRlighten or darken image edges

This will create a 3-D effect. See \fIX(1)\fP for

Use \fB-raise\fP to create a raised effect, otherwise use \fB+raise\fP.

.TP
.B "-region \fI<width>x<height>{+-}<x offset>{+-}<y offset>"\fP
\fRapply options to a portion of the image
.TP
.B "-roll \fI{+-}<x offset>{+-}<y offset>"\fP
\fRroll an image vertically or horizontally

See \fIX(1)\fP for details about
the geometry specification.


A negative \fIx offset\fP rolls the image left-to-right. A negative \fIy
offset\fP rolls the image top-to-bottom.

.TP
.B "-rotate \fIdegrees{<}{>}"\fP
\fRapply Paeth image rotation to the image

Use > to rotate the image only if its width exceeds the height.
< rotates the image \fIonly\fP if its width is less than the
height. For example, if you specify -90> and the image size is
480x640, the image is not rotated by the specified angle. However, if the
image is 640x480, it is rotated by -90 degrees.


Empty triangles left over from rotating the image are filled with the color
defined as \fBbackground\fP (class \fBbackgroundColor\fP). See \fIX(1)\fP
for details.

.TP
.B "-sample \fIgeometry"\fP
\fRscale image with pixel sampling

See \fB-geometry\fP for details about

Use this option to specify an image sequence with a single filename. See
the discussion of \fIfile\fP below for details.
.TP
.B "-seed \fIvalue"\fP
\fRpseudo-random number generator seed value
.TP
.B "-segment \fI<cluster threshold>x<smoothing threshold>"\fP
\fRsegment an image

Segment an image by analyzing the histograms of the color components and
identifying units that are homogeneous with the fuzzy c-means technique.


Specify \fIcluster threshold\fP as the number of pixels in each cluster
must exceed the the cluster threshold to be considered valid. \fISmoothing
threshold\fP eliminates noise in the second derivative of the histogram.
As the value is increased, you can expect a smoother second derivative.
The default is 1.5. See Image Segmentation for details.

.TP
.B "-shade \fI<azimuth>x<elevation>"\fP
\fRshade the image using a distant light source

Specify \fIazimuth\fP and \fIelevation\fP as the position of the light
source. Use \fB+shade\fP to return the shading results as a grayscale
image.

.TP
.B "-sharpen \fI<radius>x<sigma>"\fP
\fRsharpen the image

Use a gaussian operator of the given radius and
standard deviation (sigma). 

.TP
.B "-shave \fI<width>x<height>"\fP
\fRshave pixels from the image edges

Specify the width of the region to be removed from both
sides of the image and the height of the regions to be removed from
top and bottom.

.TP
.B "-shear \fI<x degrees>x<y degrees>"\fP
\fRshear the image along the X or Y axis

Use the specified positive or negative shear angle.


Shearing slides one edge of an image along the X or Y axis, creating a
parallelogram. An X direction shear slides an edge along the X axis, while
a Y direction shear slides an edge along the Y axis. The amount of the
shear is controlled by a shear angle. For X direction shears, \fIx degrees\fP
is measured relative to the Y axis, and similarly, for Y direction shears
\fIy
degrees\fP is measured relative to the X axis.


Empty triangles left over from shearing the image are filled with the color
defined as \fBbackground\fP (class \fBbackgroundColor\fP). See \fIX(1)\fP
for details.

.TP
.B "-size \fI<width>x<height>{+offset}"\fP
\fRwidth and height of the image

Use this option to specify the width and height of raw images whose dimensions
are unknown such as \fBGRAY\fP,
\fBRGB\fP, or \fBCMYK\fP. In addition
to width and height, use
\fB-size\fP with an offset to skip any header information in
the image or tell the number of colors in a \fBMAP\fP image
file, (e.g. -size 640x512+256).


For Photo CD images, choose from these sizes:

     192x128
     384x256
     768x512
     1536x1024
     3072x2048

Finally, use this option to choose a particular resolution layer of a JBIG
or JPEG image (e.g. -size 1024x768).

.TP
.B "-solarize \fIfactor"\fP
\fRnegate all pixels above the threshold level

Specify \fIfactor\fP as the
percent threshold of the intensity (0 - 99.9%).


This option produces a \fIsolarization\fP effect seen when exposing a
photographic film to light during the development process.

.TP
.B "-spread \fIamount"\fP
\fRdisplace image pixels by a random amount

\fIAmount\fP defines the size of the neighborhood around each pixel to
choose a candidate pixel to swap.

.TP
.B "-stackdrop \fIfile"\fP
\fRstack some images in "drop" mode

This feature is untested.

.TP
.B "-stackreplace \fIfile"\fP
\fRstack some images in "replace" mode

This feature is untested.

.TP
.B "-stroke \fIcolor"\fP
\fRcolor to use when stroking a graphic primitive

See \fB-draw\fP for further
details.

.TP
.B "-strokewidth \fIvalue"\fP
\fRset the stroke width

See \fB-draw\fP for further details.

.TP
.B "-swirl \fIdegrees"\fP
\fRswirl image pixels about the center

\fIDegrees\fP defines the tightness of the swirl.

.TP
.B "-texture \fIfilename"\fP
\fRname of texture to tile onto the image background
.TP
.B "-threshold \fIvalue"\fP
\fRthreshold the image

Create a bi-level image such that any pixel intensity that is equal or
exceeds the threshold is reassigned the maximum intensity otherwise the
minimum intensity.

.TP
.B "-tile \fIfilename"\fP
\fRtile image when filling a graphic primitive
.TP
.B "-transparent \fIcolor"\fP
\fRmake this color transparent within the image
.TP
.B "-treedepth \fIvalue"\fP
\fRtree depth for the color reduction algorithm

Normally, this integer value is zero or one. A zero or one tells display
to choose an optimal tree depth for the color reduction algorithm

An optimal depth generally allows the best representation of the source
image with the fastest computational speed and the least amount of memory.
However, the default depth is inappropriate for some images. To assure
the best representation, try values between 2 and 8 for this parameter.
Refer to
quantize for more details.


The \fB-colors\fP or \fB-monochrome\fP option is required for this option
to take effect.

.TP
.B "-type \fItype"\fP
\fRthe image type

Choose from:
\fBBilevel\fP, \fBGrayscale\fP, \fBPalette\fP,
\fBPaletteMatte\fP, \fBTrueColor\fP, \fBTrueColorMatte\fP,
\fBColorSeparation\fP, \fBColorSeparationMatte\fP, or \fBOptimize\fP.

.TP
.B "-units \fItype"\fP
\fRthe type of image resolution

Choose from: \fBUndefined\fP, \fBPixelsPerInch\fP, or
\fBPixelsPerCentimeter\fP.

.TP
.B "-unsharp \fI<radius>x<sigma>"\fP
\fRsharpen the image with an unsharp mask operator

Use the given radius and standard deviation (sigma).

.TP
.B "-use_pixmap"
\fRuse the pixmap
.TP
.B "-verbose"
\fRprint detailed information about the image
.TP
.B "-view \fIstring"\fP
\fRFlashPix viewing parameters
.TP
.B "-wave \fI<amplitude>x<wavelength>"\fP
\fRalter an image along a sine wave

Specify \fIamplitude\fP and \fIwavelength\fP to effect the characteristics
of the wave.

.SH PROCESSING ORDER

Options are processed in command line order.  Any option you
specify on the command line remains in effect until it is
explicitly changed by specifying the option again with a
different effect.  Some options only affect the decoding of
images and others only the encoding.
.SH FILES AND FORMATS

By default, the image format is determined by its magic number. To specify
a particular image format, precede the filename with an image format name
and a colon (\fIi.e.\fP\fBps:image\fP) or specify the image type as the
filename suffix

When you specify \fBX\fP as your image type, the filename has special
meaning. It specifies an X window by \fBid, name\fP, or
\fBroot\fP. If
no filename is specified, the window is selected by clicking the mouse
in the desired window.

Specify \fIinput_file\fP as - for standard input,
\fIoutput_file\fP
as - for standard output. If \fIinput_file\fP has the extension
\fB.Z\fP or
\fB.gz\fP, the file is uncompressed with \fBuncompress\fP or \fBgunzip\fP
respectively. If \fIoutput_file\fP has the extension \fB.Z\fP or
\fB.gz\fP,
the file size is compressed using with \fBcompress\fP or \fBgzip\fP
respectively.  Finally, precede the image file name with | to pipe to or
from a system command.

Use an optional index enclosed in brackets after a file name to specify
a desired subimage of a multi-resolution image format like Photo CD (e.g.
img0001.pcd[4]) or a range for MPEG images (e.g. video.mpg[50-75]). A subimage
specification can be disjoint (e.g. image.tiff[2,7,4]). For raw images,
specify a subimage with a geometry (e.g. -size 640x512 image.rgb[320x256+50+50]).
Single images are written with the filename you specify. However, multi-part
images (i.e. a multi-page PostScript document with \fB+adjoin\fP specified)
are written with the filename followed by a period (\fB.\fP) and the scene
number. You can change this behavior by embedding a \fBprintf\fP format
specification in the file name. For example,

    image%02d.miff

converts files image00.miff, image01.miff, etc.

Prepend an at sign @ to a filename to read a list of image
filenames from that file. This is convenient in the event you have too
many image filenames to fit on the command line.
.SH SEGMENTATION

Use \fB-segment\fP to segment an image by analyzing the histograms of
the color components and identifying units that are homogeneous with the
fuzzy c-means technique. The scale-space filter analyzes the histograms
of the three color components of the image and identifies a set of classes.
The extents of each class is used to coarsely segment the image with thresholding.
The color associated with each class is determined by the mean color of
all pixels within the extents of a particular class. Finally, any unclassified
pixels are assigned to the closest class with the fuzzy c-means technique.

The fuzzy c-Means algorithm can be summarized as follows:

    
Build a histogram, one for each color component of the image.
    
For each histogram, successively apply the scale- space filter and build
an interval tree of zero crossings in the second derivative at each scale.
Analyze this scale-space ``fingerprint'' to determine which peaks or valleys
in the histogram are most predominant.
    
The fingerprint defines intervals on the axis of the histogram. Each interval
contains either a minima or a maxima in the original signal. If each color
component lies within the maxima interval, that pixel is considered ``classified''
and is assigned an unique class number.
    
Any pixel that fails to be classified in the above thresholding pass is
classified using the fuzzy c-Means technique. It is assigned to one of
the classes discovered in the histogram analysis phase.


The fuzzy c-Means technique attempts to cluster a pixel by finding the
local minima of the generalized within group sum of squared error objective
function. A pixel is assigned to the closest class of which the fuzzy membership
has a maximum value.
