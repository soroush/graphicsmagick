.SH NAME
animate - animate a sequence of images
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBanimate\fP \fB[\fP \fIoptions\fP \fB...]\fP \fIfile\fP [ [
\fIoptions\fP ...] \fIfile\fP ...]

.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBAnimate\fP displays a sequence of images on any workstation display
running an X server. \fBanimate\fP first determines the hardware capabilities
of the workstation. If the number of unique colors in an image is less
than or equal to the number the workstation can support, the image is displayed
in an X window. Otherwise the number of colors in the image is first reduced
to match the color resolution of the workstation before it is displayed.

This means that a continuous-tone 24 bits-per-pixel image can display on
a 8 bit pseudo-color device or monochrome device. In most instances the
reduced color image closely resembles the original. Alternatively, a monochrome
or pseudo-color image sequence can display on a continuous-tone 24 bits-per-pixel
device.

To help prevent color flashing on X server visuals that have colormaps,
\fBanimate\fP
creates a single colormap from the image sequence. This can be rather time
consuming. You can speed this operation up by reducing the colors in the
image before you "animate" them. Use \fBmogrify\fP to color reduce the
images to a single colormap. See \fBmogrify(1)\fP for details. Alternatively,
you can use a Standard Colormap; or a static, direct, or true color visual.
You can define a Standard Colormap with \fIxstdcmap\fP. See \fBxstdcmap(1)\fP
for details. This method is recommended for colormapped X server because
it eliminates the need to compute a global colormap.
.SH EXAMPLES

To animate a set of images of a cockatoo, use:


    animate cockatoo.*

To animate a cockatoo image sequence while using the Standard Colormap
\fIbest\fP, use:


    xstdcmap -best
    animate -map best cockatoo.*

To animate an image of a cockatoo without a border centered on a backdrop,
use:


    animate +borderwidth -backdrop cockatoo.*
.SH OPTIONS

Options are processed in command line order. Any option you specify on
the command line remains in effect until it is explicitly changed by specifying
the option again with a different effect.

\fBAnimate\fP options can appear on the command line or in your X resources
file. See \fIX(1)\fP. Options on the command line supersede values specified
in your X resources file.
.TP
.B "-backdrop \fI<color>"\fP
\fRdisplay the image centered on a backdrop.

This backdrop covers the entire workstation screen and is useful for hiding
other X window activity while viewing the image. The color of the backdrop
is specified as the background color.
The color is specified using the format described in the "Color Names"
section of \fIX(1)\fP.
Refer to
"X Resources", below,
for details.

.TP
.B "-background \fI<color>"\fP
\fRthe background color

The color is specified using the format described in the "Color Names"
section of \fIX(1)\fP.
.TP
.B "-bordercolor \fI<color>"\fP
\fRthe border color

The color is specified using the format described in the "Color Names"
section of \fIX(1)\fP.
.TP
.B "-borderwidth \fI<geometry>"\fP
\fRthe border width
.TP
.B "-cache \fI<threshold>"\fP
\fRmegabytes of memory available to the pixel cache

Image pixels are stored in memory until 80 megabytes of memory have been
consumed. Subsequent pixel operations are cached on disk. Operations to
memory are significantly faster but if your computer does not have a sufficient
amount of free memory you may want to adjust this threshold value.

.TP
.B "-chop \fI<width>x<height>{+-}<x offset>{+-}<y offset>{%}"\fP
\fRremove pixels from the interior of an image

The width and height give the number of columns and rows to remove,
and the offsets give the location of the leftmost column and topmost
row to remove.


The x offset normally specifies the leftmost column to remove.
If the \fB-gravity\fP option is present with \fINorthEast, East,\fP
or \fISouthEast\fP
gravity, it gives the distance leftward from the right edge
of the image to the rightmost column to remove.  Similarly, the y offset
normally specifies the topmost row to remove, but if
the \fB-gravity\fP option is present with \fISouthWest, South,\fP
or \fISouthEast\fP
gravity, it specifies the distance upward from the bottom edge of the
image to the bottom row to remove.

The \fB-chop\fP option removes entire rows and columns,
and moves the remaining corner blocks leftward and upward to close the gaps.

.TP
.B "-colormap \fI<type>"\fP
\fRdefine the colormap type

Choose between \fBshared\fP or \fBprivate\fP.


This option only applies when the default X server visual is \fIPseudoColor\fP
or \fIGRAYScale\fP. Refer to \fB-visual\fP for more details. By default,
a shared colormap is allocated. The image shares colors with other X clients.
Some image colors could be approximated, therefore your image may look
very different than intended. Choose \fBPrivate\fP and the image colors
appear exactly as they are defined. However, other clients may
go \fItechnicolor\fP when the image colormap is installed.
.TP
.B "-colors \fI<value>"\fP
\fRpreferred number of colors in the image

The actual number of colors in the image may be less than your request,
but never more. Note, this is a color reduction option. Images with less
unique colors than specified with this option will have any duplicate or
unused colors removed. Refer to quantize for
more details.


Note, options \fB-dither\fP, \fB-colorspace\fP, and \fB-treedepth\fP
affect the color reduction algorithm.

.TP
.B "-colorspace \fI<value>"\fP
\fRthe type of colorspace

Choices are: \fBGRAY\fP, \fBOHTA\fP, \fBRGB\fP,
\fBTransparent\fP,
\fBXYZ\fP,
\fBYCbCr\fP, \fBYIQ\fP, \fBYPbPr\fP,
\fBYUV\fP, or \fBCMYK\fP.


Color reduction, by default, takes place in the RGB color space. Empirical
evidence suggests that distances in color spaces such as YUV or YIQ correspond
to perceptual color differences more closely than do distances in RGB space.
These color spaces may give better results when color reducing an image.
Refer to quantize for more details.


The \fBTransparent\fP color space behaves uniquely in that it preserves
the matte channel of the image if it exists.


The \fB-colors\fP or \fB-monochrome\fP option is required for this
option to take effect.

.TP
.B "-crop \fI<width>x<height>{+-}<x offset>{+-}<y offset>{%}"\fP
\fRpreferred size and location of the cropped image

See \fB-geometry\fP for details
about the geometry specification.


The width and height give the size of the image that remains after cropping,
and the offsets give the location of the top left corner of the cropped
image with respect to the original image.  To specify the amount to be
removed, use \fB-shave\fP instead.


To specify a percentage width or height to be removed instead, append
\fB%\fP. For example
to crop the image by ten percent (five percent on each side of the image),
use \fB-crop 10%\fP.


The x and y offsets specify the location of the upper left corner of
the cropping region measured downward and rightward with respect to the
upper left corner of the image.
If the \fB-gravity\fP option is present with \fINorthEast, East,\fP
or \fISouthEast\fP
gravity, it gives the distance leftward from the right edge
of the image to the right edge of the cropping region.  Similarly, if
the \fB-gravity\fP option is present with \fISouthWest, South,\fP
or \fISouthEast\fP
gravity, the distance is measured upward between the bottom
edges.

Omit the x and y offset to generate one or more subimages of a uniform
size.

.TP
.B "-debug"
\fRenable debug printout
.TP
.B "-delay \fI<1/100ths of a second>"\fP
\fRdisplay the next image after pausing

This option is useful for regulating the animation of image sequences
\fIDelay/100\fP seconds must expire before the display
of the next image. The default is no delay between each showing of the
image sequence. The maximum delay is 65535.


You can specify a delay range (e.g. \fI-delay 10-500\fP) which sets the
minimum and maximum delay.

.TP
.B "-density \fI<width>x<height>"\fP
\fRvertical and horizontal resolution in pixels of the image

This option specifies an image density when decoding a \fIPostScript\fP
or Portable Document page. The default is 72 dots per inch in the horizontal
and vertical direction. This option is used in concert with \fB-page\fP.

.TP
.B "-depth \fI<value>"\fP
\fRdepth of the image

This is the number of bits in a color sample within a pixel. The only
acceptable values are 8 or 16.  Use this option to specify the depth of
raw images whose depth is unknown such as GRAY, RGB, or CMYK, or to change
the depth of any image after it has been read.

.TP
.B "-display \fI<host:display[.screen]>"\fP
\fRspecifies the X server to contact
.TP
.B "-dispose \fI<method>"\fP
\fRGIF disposal method

Here are the valid methods:


     0     No disposal specified.
     1     Do not dispose between frames.      
     2     Overwrite frame with background color from header.
     3     Overwrite with previous frame.
.TP
.B "-dither"
\fRapply Floyd/Steinberg error diffusion to the image

The basic strategy of dithering is to trade intensity resolution for spatial
resolution by averaging the intensities of several neighboring pixels.
Images which suffer from severe contouring when reducing colors can be
improved with this option.


The \fB-colors\fP or \fB-monochrome\fP option is required for this option
to take effect.


Use \fB+dither\fP to turn off dithering and to render Postscript without
text or graphic aliasing.

.TP
.B "-font \fI<name>"\fP
\fRuse this font when annotating the image with text

You can tag a font to specify whether it is a Postscript, Truetype, or OPTION1
font.  For example, Arial.ttf is a Truetype font, ps:helvetica
is Postscript, and x:fixed is OPTION1. 

.TP
.B "-foreground \fI<color>"\fP
\fRdefine the foreground color

The color is specified using the format described in the "Color Names"
section of \fIX(1)\fP.
.TP
.B "-gamma \fI<value>"\fP
\fRlevel of gamma correction

The same color image displayed on two different workstations may look different
due to differences in the display monitor. Use gamma correction to adjust
for this color difference. Reasonable values extend from \fB0.8\fP to
\fB2.3\fP.


You can apply separate gamma values to the red, green, and blue channels
of the image with a gamma value list delineated with slashes
(i.e. \fB1.7\fP/\fB2.3\fP/\fB1.2\fP).


Use \fB+gamma\fP \fIvalue\fP
to set the image gamma level without actually adjusting
the image pixels. This option is useful if the image is of a known gamma
but not set as an image attribute (e.g. PNG images).

.TP
.B "-geometry \fI<width>x<height>{+-}<x offset>{+-}<y offset>{%}{@}{!}{<}{>}"\fP
\fRpreferred size and location of the Image window.

By default, the window size is the image
size and the location is chosen by you when it is mapped.


By default, the width and height are maximum values. That is, the image
is expanded or contracted to fit the width and height value while maintaining
the aspect ratio of the image. \fIAppend an exclamation point to the geometry
to force the image size to exactly the size you specify\fP. For example,
if you specify 640x480! the image width is set to 640 pixels and
height to 480.


If only the width is specified, the width assumes the
value and the height is chosen to maintain the aspect ratio of the image.
Similarly, if only the height is specified (e.g., -geometry x256),
the width is chosen to maintain the aspect ratio. 


To specify a percentage width or height instead, append %. The image size
is multiplied by the width and height percentages to obtain the final image
dimensions. To increase the size of an image, use a value greater than
100 (e.g. 125%). To decrease an image's size, use a percentage less than
100.


Use @ to specify the maximum area in pixels of an image.


Use > to change the dimensions of the image \fIonly\fP if
its size exceeds the geometry specification. < resizes the image
\fIonly\fP
if its dimensions is less than the geometry specification. For example,
if you specify '640x480>' and the image size is 512x512, the image
size does not change. However, if the image is 1024x1024, it is resized
to 640x480.  Enclose the geometry specification in quotation marks to
prevent the < or > from being interpreted by your shell
as a file redirection.


When used with \fIanimate\fP and \fIdisplay\fP, offsets are handled in
the same manner as in \fIX(1)\fP and the \fB-gravity\fP option is not used.
If the \fIx offset\fP is negative, the offset is measured leftward
from the right edge of the
screen to the right edge of the image being displayed.
Similarly, negative \fIy offset\fP is measured between the bottom edges.
.TP
.B "-help"
\fRprint usage instructions
.TP
.B "-iconGeometry \fI<geometry>"\fP
\fRspecify the icon geometry

Offsets, if present in the geometry specification, are handled in
the same manner as the \fB-geometry\fP option, using X11 style to handle
negative offsets.
.TP
.B "-iconic"
\fRiconic animation
.TP
.B "-interlace \fI<type>"\fP
\fRthe type of interlacing scheme

Choices are: \fBNone, Line, Plane,\fP
or \fBPartition\fP. The default is \fBNone\fP.


This option is used to specify the type of interlacing scheme for raw image
formats such as \fBRGB\fP or \fBYUV\fP. \fBNone\fP means do not interlace
(RGBRGBRGBRGBRGBRGB...), \fBLine\fP uses scanline interlacing
(RRR...GGG...BBB...RRR...GGG...BBB...),
and \fBPlane\fP uses plane interlacing (RRRRRR...GGGGGG...BBBBBB...).
\fBPartition\fP
is like plane except the different planes are saved to individual files
(e.g. image.R, image.G, and image.B).

.TP
.B "-map \fI<type>"\fP
\fR
display image using this type.
[\fIanimate\fP or \fIdisplay\fP]

Choose from these \fIStandard Colormap\fP types:

     best
     default
     gray
     red
     green
     blue

The \fIX server\fP must support the \fIStandard Colormap\fP you choose,
otherwise an error occurs. Use \fBlist\fP as the type and \fBdisplay\fP
searches the list of colormap types in \fBtop-to-bottom\fP order until
one is located. See \fIxstdcmap(1)\fP for one way of creating Standard
Colormaps.
.TP
.B "-matte"
\fRstore matte channel if the image has one

If the image does not have a matte channel, create an opaque one.


Use \fB+matte\fP to ignore the matte channel and to avoid writing a
matte channel in the output file.
.TP
.B "-mattecolor \fI<color>"\fP
\fRspecify the matte color

The color is specified using the format described in the "Color Names"
section of \fIX(1)\fP.
.TP
.B "-monochrome"
\fRtransform the image to black and white
.TP
.B "-name"
\fRname an image
.TP
.B "-pause \fI<seconds>"\fP
\fRpause between animation loops

Pause for the specified number of seconds before repeating the
animation.
.TP
.B "-remote"
\fRperform a remote operation

The only command recognized at this time is the name of
an image file to load.

.TP
.B "-rotate \fI<degrees{<}{>}>"\fP
\fRapply Paeth image rotation to the image

Use > to rotate the image only if its width exceeds the height.
< rotates the image \fIonly\fP if its width is less than the
height. For example, if you specify -rotate "-90>" and the image
size is 480x640, the image is not rotated.  However, if the
image is 640x480, it is rotated by -90 degrees.  If you use > or
<, enclose it in quotation marks to prevent it from being
misinterpreted as a file redirection.


Empty triangles left over from rotating the image are filled with the color
defined as \fBbackground\fP (class \fBbackgroundColor\fP). See \fIX(1)\fP
for details.

.TP
.B "-scene \fI<value{-value}>"\fP
\fRimage scene number or range

Use this option
.TP
.B "-shared_memory"
\fRuse shared memory

This option specifies whether the utility should attempt use shared memory
for pixmaps.  ImageMagick must be compiled with shared memory support,
and the display must support the \fIMIT-SHM\fP extension.  Otherwise, this
option is ignored.  The default is \fBTrue\fP.

.TP
.B "-size \fI<width>x<height>{+offset}"\fP
\fRwidth and height of the image

Use this option to specify the width and height of raw images whose dimensions
are unknown such as \fBGRAY\fP,
\fBRGB\fP, or \fBCMYK\fP. In addition
to width and height, use
\fB-size\fP with an offset to skip any header information in
the image or tell the number of colors in a \fBMAP\fP image
file, (e.g. -size 640x512+256).


For Photo CD images, choose from these sizes:

     192x128
     384x256
     768x512
     1536x1024
     3072x2048

Finally, use this option to choose a particular resolution layer of a JBIG
or JPEG image (e.g. -size 1024x768).

.TP
.B "-text_font \fI<name>"\fP
\fRfont for writing fixed-width text

Specifies the name of the preferred font to use in fixed (typewriter style)
formatted text.  The default is 14 point \fICourier\fP.


You can tag a font to specify whether it is a Postscript, Truetype, or
OPTION1 font.  For example, Courier.ttf is a Truetype font
and x:fixed is OPTION1. 

.TP
.B "-title \fI<string>"\fP
\fRassign a title to the displayed image

Use this option to assign a specific title to the image. This is assigned
to the image window and is typically displayed in the window title bar.
Optionally you can include the image filename, type, width, height, or
other image attribute by embedding special format characters:

     %b   file size
     %c   comment
     %d   directory
     %e   filename extention
     %f   filename
     %g   group number
     %h   height
     %i   input filename
     %k   number of unique colors
     %l   label
     %m   magick
     %n   number of scenes
     %o   output filename
     %p   page number
     %q   quantum depth
     %s   scene number
     %t   top of filename
     %u   unique temporary filename
     %w   width
     %x   x resolution
     %y   y resolution
     %#   signature
     \\n   newline
     \\r   carriage return

For example,


     -title "%m:%f %wx%h"

produces an image title of MIFF:bird.miff 512x480 for an image
titled bird.miff and whose width is 512 and height is 480.

.TP
.B "-treedepth \fI<value>"\fP
\fRtree depth for the color reduction algorithm

Normally, this integer value is zero or one. A zero or one tells display
to choose an optimal tree depth for the color reduction algorithm

An optimal depth generally allows the best representation of the source
image with the fastest computational speed and the least amount of memory.
However, the default depth is inappropriate for some images. To assure
the best representation, try values between 2 and 8 for this parameter.
Refer to
quantize for more details.


The \fB-colors\fP or \fB-monochrome\fP option is required for this option
to take effect.

.TP
.B "-trim"
\fRtrim an image

This option removes any edges that are exactly the same color as the
corner pixels.  Use \fB-fuzz\fP to make \fB-trim\fP remove edges that
are nearly the same color as the corner pixels.
.TP
.B "-verbose"
\fRprint detailed information about the image
.TP
.B "-visual \fI<type>"\fP
\fRanimate images using this X visual type

Choose from these visual classes:


     StaticGray
     GrayScale
     StaticColor
     PseudoColor
     TrueColor
     DirectColor
     default
     visual id

The X server must support the visual you choose, otherwise an error occurs.
If a visual is not specified, the visual class that can display the most
simultaneous colors on the default screen is chosen.

.TP
.B "-window \fI<id>"\fP
\fRmake image the background of a window

\fIid\fP can be a window id or name.  Specify \fBroot\fP to
select X's root window as the target window.


By default the image is tiled onto the background of the target
window.   If \fBbackdrop\fP or \fB-geometry\fP are
specified, the image is surrounded by the background color.  Refer to
\fBX RESOURCES\fP for details.


The image will not display on the root window if the image has more
unique colors than the target window colormap allows.  Use
\fB-colors\fP to reduce the number of colors.

.SH FILES AND FORMATS

Any option you specify on the command line remains in effect until it is
explicitly changed by specifying the option again with a different effect.
For example, to animate two images, the first with 32 colors and the second
with only 16 colors, use:


     animate -colors 32 cockatoo.1 -colors 16 cockatoo.2

By default, the image format is determined by its magic number. To specify
a particular image format, precede the filename with an image format name
and a colon (i.e. ps:image) or specify the image type as the filename suffix
(i.e. image.ps). See \fBconvert(1)\fP for a list of valid image formats.

When you specify \fBX\fP as your image type, the filename has special
meaning. It specifies an X window by id, name, or
\fBroot\fP. If no filename
is specified, the window is selected by clicking the mouse in the desired
window.

Specify \fIfile\fP as - for standard input.  If \fIfile\fP has the extension
\fB.Z\fP
or \fB.gz\fP, the file is uncompressed with
\fBuncompress\fP or \fBgunzip\fP
respectively. Precede the image file name with | to pipe from a system
command.

Use an optional index enclosed in brackets after a file name to specify
a desired subimage of a multi-resolution image format like Photo CD (e.g.
img0001.pcd[4]) or a range for MPEG images (e.g. video.mpg[50-75]). A subimage
specification can be disjoint (e.g. image.tiff[2,7,4]). For raw images,
specify a subimage with a geometry
(e.g. -size 640x512 image.rgb[320x256+50+50]).

Single images are read with the filename you specify. Alternatively, you
can animate an image sequence with a single filename. Define the range
of the image sequence with \fB-scene\fP. Each image in the range is read
with the filename followed by a period (\fB.\fP) and the scene number.
You can change this behavior by embedding a \fBprintf\fP format specification
in the file name. For example,


    animate -scene 0-9 image%02d.miff

animates files image00.miff, image01.miff, through image09.miff.
Image filenames may appear in any order on the command line if the image
format is \fIMIFF\fP (refer to \fBmiff(5)\fP and the
\fBscene\fP keyword
is specified in the image. Otherwise the images will display in the order
they appear on the command line.
