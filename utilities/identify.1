identify - describe an image or image sequence.
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBidentify\fP \fIfile\fP [ \fIfile\fP ... ]

.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBIdentify\fP describes the format and characteristics of one or more
image files. It will also report if an image is incomplete or corrupt.
The information displayed includes the scene number, the file name, the
width and height of the image, whether the image is colormapped or not,
the number of colors in the image, the number of bytes in the image, the
format of the image (JPEG, PNM, etc.), and finally the number of seconds
it took to read and process the image. An example line output
from \fBidentify\fP follows:

    images/aquarium.miff 640x480 PseudoClass 256c
           308135b MIFF 1s

If -verbose is set, expect additional output including any image
comment:
