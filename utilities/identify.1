.SH NAME
identify - describe the format and characteristics of one or more image
files.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "identify"
[ \fIoptions\fP ... ] \fIfile\fP [ \fIfile\fP ... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBidentify\fP describes the format and characteristics of one or more image
files.  It will also report if an image is incomplete or corrupt.
The information displayed includes the scene number, the file name, the
width and height of the image, whether the image is colormapped or not,
the number of colors in the image, the number of bytes in the image, the
format of the image (JPEG, PNM, etc.), and finally the number of seconds
it took to read and process the image.  An example line output from
\fBidentify\fP follows:

.nf
     images/aquarium.miff 640x480 PseudoClass 256c 308135b MIFF 1s
.fi

If \fB-verbose\fP is set, expect additional output including any image
comment:

.nf
     Image: images/aquarium.miff
       class: PseudoClass
       colors: 256
       signature: eb5dca81dd93ae7e6ffae99a5275a53e
       matte: False
       geometry: 640x480
       depth: 8
       bytes: 308135
       format: MIFF

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.B "-cache \fIthreshold"

\fRmegabytes of memory available to the pixel cache


Image pixels are stored in memory until 80 megabytes of memory have been
consumed. Subsequent pixel operations are cached on disk. Operations to
memory are significantly faster but if your computer does not have a sufficient
amount of free memory you may want to adjust this threshold value.


.TP
.B "-debug"

\fRenable debug printout

.TP
.B "-density \fI<width>x<height>"

\fRvertical and horizontal resolution in pixels of the image


This option specifies an image density when decoding a \fIPostScript\fP
or Portable Document page. The default is 72 dots per inch in the horizontal
and vertical direction. This option is used in concert with \fB-page\fP.


.TP
.B "-depth \fIvalue"

\fRdepth of the image


This is the number of bits in a pixel. The only acceptable
values are 8 or 16.  Use this option to specify the depth of raw images whose
depth is unknown such as GRAY, RGB, or CMYK, or to change the depth of any
image after it has been read.


.TP
.B "-format \fI"string""

\fRoutput formatted image characteristics

.TP
.B "-geometry \fI<width>x<height>{+-}<x offset>{+-}<y offset>{%}{@}{!}{<}{>}"

\fRpreferred size and location of the Image window.

See \fIX(1)\fP for details
about the geometry specification. By default, the window size is the image
size and the location is chosen by you when it is mapped.



By default, the width and height are maximum values. That is, the image
is expanded or contracted to fit the width and height value while maintaining
the aspect ratio of the image. \fIAppend an exclamation point to the geometry
to force the image size to exactly the size you specify\fP. For example,
if you specify \fB640x480!\fP the image width is set to 640 pixels and
height to 480. If only one factor is specified, both the width and height
assume the value.



To specify a percentage width or height instead, append %. The image size
is multiplied by the width and height percentages to obtain the final image
dimensions. To increase the size of an image, use a value greater than
100 (e.g. 125%). To decrease an image's size, use a percentage less than
100.



Use \fB@\fP to specify the maximum area in pixels of an image.



Use \fB>\fP to change the dimensions of the image \fIonly\fP if
its size exceeds the geometry specification. \fB<\fP resizes the image
\fIonly\fP
if its dimensions is less than the geometry specification. For example,
if you specify \fB'640x480>'\fP and the image size is 512x512, the image
size does not change. However, if the image is 1024x1024, it is resized
to 640x480.


Use \fB<\fP to change the dimensions of the image \fIonly\fP if
its size exceeds the geometry specification. \fB>\fP resizes the image
\fIonly\fP
if its dimensions is less than the geometry specification. For example,
if you specify \fB640x480>\fP and the image size is 512x512, the image
size does not change. However, if the image is 1024x1024, it is resized
to 640x480.


There are 72 pixels per inch in PostScript coordinates.


.TP
.B "-help"

\fRprint usage instructions

.TP
.B "-ping"

\fRefficiently determine image characteristics

.TP
.B "-size \fI<width>x<height>{+offset}"

\fRwidth and height of the image


Use this option to specify the width and height of raw images whose dimensions
are unknown such as \fBGRAY\fP,
\fBRGB\fP, or \fBCMYK\fP. In addition
to width and height, use
\fB-size\fP with an offset to skip any header information in
the image or tell the number of colors in a \fBMAP\fP image
file, (e.g. -size 640x512+256).



For Photo CD images, choose from these sizes:

     192x128
     384x256
     768x512
     1536x1024
     3072x2048


Finally, use this option to choose a particular resolution layer of a JBIG
or JPEG image (e.g. -size 1024x768).


.TP
.B "-verbose"

\fRprint detailed information about the image


This information is printed: image scene number; image name; image size;
the image class (\fIDirectClass\fP or \fIPseudoClass\fP); the total number
of unique colors; and the number of seconds to read and transform the image.
Refer to <a href="miff.html">miff</a> for a description of the image class.



If \fB-colors\fP is also specified, the total unique colors in the image
and color reduction error values are printed. Refer to <a href="quantize.html">quantize</a>
for a description of these values.
