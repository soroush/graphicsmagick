Welcome to ImageMagick!

  ImageMagick is copyrighted (C) by ImageMagick Studio. It is free for
  any use, commercial or private. However, this installation package is
  based on additional programs and libraries which use a different
  license than ImageMagick. None of these licenses prohibit you from
  using this package for commercial or private use, but they may impose
  requirements on re-distribution of the package. Please see the
  'licenses' subdirectory in the package installation directory after
  you the package is installed to view the license restrictions of
  additional package components.

Installation

   Please note that the user who installs this package may require
   "Administrator" privileges in order to properly ImageMagick.

  Prerequisites
  
    While multiple versions of ImageMagick may be installed at one time,
    if your intention is to replace a prior installation of ImageMagick
    with a newer version, then it may be wise to uninstall the existing
    ImageMagick prior to installing the newer version.
  
    While it is not a requirement, it is recommended that the
    Ghostscript package be installed. ImageMagick uses Ghostscript to
    render Postscript and PDF files, as well as formats where a
    translator to Postscript is available. ImageMagick will use the
    fonts delivered with Ghostscript to support the set of standard
    Postscript fonts.
    
    The installation package includes the ImageMagick Perl extension (
    PerlMagick) as an installation option. If you would like to use this
    extension, then you should install ActiveState ActivePerl prior to
    commencing with installation of ImageMagick.
  
  Retrieve Install Package
  
    Retrieve the ImageMagick Windows binary install package from a one
    of the ftp sites listed at the ImageMagick Download Sites page. The
    file will be named similar to ImageMagick-5.4.9-win2k.exe and should
    be found in the 'binaries' subdirectory of the ftp site.
  
  Start Installation Wizard
  
    Execute the downloaded file from your browser or by double-clicking
    on the filename from within Windows Explorer. The ImageMagick Setup
    Wizard will appear. Click on "Next" to continue.
  
  Select Destination Directory
  
    Specify what drive and directory to install ImageMagick into.
    Approximately 13MB of free disk space is required to install
    ImageMagick. The default installation directory is similar to
    "C:\Program Files\ImageMagick-5.4.9-Q16". Once you have entered the
    desired installation directory, then select "Next>" to continue.
  
  Select Start Menu Folder
  
    Select the folder where you would like the program's shortcuts to
    appear. The default should normally be satisfactory. Click on
    "Next>" to continue.
  
  Select Additional Tasks
  
    A screen is displayed which provides the option to create a desktop
    shortcut icon to the imdisplay program and to update the executable
    search path so that ImageMagick is available without specifying the
    full path to the programs. The default is to enable both of these.
    Once you have made your selections, click on "Next>" to continue.
  
  Ready to Install
  
    A screen is displayed which displays the selected options. If you
    are not satisfied with a selected option, then click on "<Back" to
    go back to a previous screen so that the option may be adjusted. If
    you are satisfied with the options and are ready to install, then
    select "Install". To abort the installation entirely, select "Cancel".
  
  Installation Progress
  
    While the install program is performing the installation, it will
    display what it is doing in an installation progress window.
  
  Finishing Up
  
    By default "View ImageMagick.html" is check-marked. This causes the
    ImageMagick web pages to be displayed in a browser when "Finish" is
    selected. If you do not want to view the web pages, then de-select
    "View ImageMagick.html". Select "Finish" to exit the installation
    program. Under Windows '95 and Windows '98 it will be necessary to
    reboot the system in order for some settings to take effect (such as
    executable search path) since these are set in autoexec.bat.
  
  Testing The Installation
  
    Select "Command Prompt" from the Windows Start menu. Within the
    window type
    
      convert logo: logo.miff
      imdisplay logo.miff
    
    and the ImageMagick logo should be displayed in a window.
