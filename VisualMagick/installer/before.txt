Welcome to ImageMagick!

  ImageMagick is copyrighted (C) by ImageMagick Studio. It is free for
  any use, commercial or private. However, this installation package is
  based on additional programs and libraries which use a different
  license than ImageMagick. None of these licenses prohibit you from
  using this package for commercial or private use, but they may impose
  requirements on re-distribution of the package. Please see the
  'licenses' subdirectory in the package installation directory after
  you the package is installed to view the license restrictions of
  additional package components.


Before You Start

  Please note that the user who installs this package may require
  "Administrator" privileges in order to properly ImageMagick.

  While multiple versions of ImageMagick may be installed at one time,
  if your intention is to replace a prior installation of ImageMagick
  with a newer version, then it may be wise to uninstall the existing
  ImageMagick prior to installing the newer version.

  Before installing ImageMagick, please make sure that you are
  installing the current release version. The current release version is
  posted to the site "http://www.imagemagick.org". Before submitting a
  bug report please ensure that you are using the current release version.
  
  While it is not a requirement, it is recommended that the Ghostscript
  package be installed. ImageMagick uses Ghostscript to render
  Postscript and PDF files, as well as formats where a translator to
  Postscript is available. ImageMagick will use the fonts delivered with
  Ghostscript to support the set of standard Postscript fonts.
  
  The installation package includes the Perl Image::Magick extension
  (PerlMagick) as an installation option. If you would like to use this
  extension, then you should install ActiveState ActivePerl prior to
  commencing with installation of ImageMagick. If you should decide to
  install ActivePerl later, you can simply re-run this installation
  program to install PerlMagick.
  
Installation Steps

  The following describes the steps remaining to install ImageMagick.
  
  Select Destination Directory
  
    Specify what drive and directory to install ImageMagick into.
    Approximately 13MB of free disk space is required to install
    ImageMagick. The default installation directory is similar to
    "C:\Program Files\ImageMagick-5.4.9-Q16". Once you have entered the
    desired installation directory, then select "Next>" to continue.
  
  Select Start Menu Folder
  
    Select the folder where you would like the program's shortcuts to
    appear. The default should normally be satisfactory. Click on
    "Next>" to continue.
  
  Select Additional Tasks
  
    A screen is displayed which provides the following options

      o Create a desktop icon

        This option adds an icon to the desktop for ImageMagick's
        display program.

      o Update executable search path

        This option adds the ImageMagick installation directory to the
        executable search path.

      o Associate supported file extensions with ImageMagick

        Regardless of this setting, formats which are invented by
        ImageMagick will be associated with ImageMagick. If this box is
        checkmarked, then *all* image formats that ImageMagick supports
        (including popular formats like GIF, JPEG, TIFF, PDF, and
        Postscript) will be associated with the ImageMagick display
        program. Please consider carefully if you want to do this!

      o Install PerlMagick for ActiveState Perl v5.6.1

        This option runs the Perl installer to install the Image::Magick
        extension.

      o Install ImageMagickObject OLE Control

        This option registers the ImageMagickObject DLL as an OLE Control
        to support use from languages which support using COM objects.

    Please ensure that you are satisified with your selections prior
    to continuing.
  
  Ready to Install
  
    A screen is displayed which displays the selected options. If you
    are not satisfied with a selected option, then click on "<Back" to
    go back to a previous screen so that the option may be adjusted. If
    you are satisfied with the options and are ready to install, then
    select "Install". To abort the installation entirely, select "Cancel".
  
  Installation Progress
  
    While the install program is performing the installation, it will
    display what it is doing in an installation progress window.
  
  Finishing Up
  
    By default "View ImageMagick.html" is check-marked. This causes the
    ImageMagick web pages to be displayed in a browser when "Finish" is
    selected. If you do not want to view the web pages, then de-select
    "View ImageMagick.html". Select "Finish" to exit the installation
    program. Under Windows '95 and Windows '98 it will be necessary to
    reboot the system in order for some settings to take effect (such as
    executable search path) since these are set in autoexec.bat.
  
  Testing The Installation
  
    Select "Command Prompt" from the Windows Start menu. Within the
    window type
    
      convert logo: logo.miff
      imdisplay logo.miff
    
    and the ImageMagick logo should be displayed in a window.
