You have now installed ImageMagick. To test the installation select
"Command Prompt" from the Windows Start menu. Within the window type
    
        convert logo: logo.miff
        imdisplay logo.miff
    
and the ImageMagick logo should be displayed in a window.

If you selected to create a desktop icon, an icon labeled "ImageMagick
Display" will appear on your desktop. Double clicking brings up
ImageMagick's image display program. Please be patient with us. The
image display program is still under development.

For your convenience, the full content of the ImageMagick web site has
been installed on your computer. This is available from the Windows
start menu via "ImageMagick 5.4.9" -> "ImageMagick Web Pages".
