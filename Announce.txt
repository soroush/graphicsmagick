Subject: ImageMagick 5.2.9 - tools and libraries for image manipulation

The ImageMagick Studio LLC development group is proud to announce the
release of ImageMagick 5.2.9.  Version 5.2.9 is a bug-fix release to
resolve bugs reported against 5.2.8.

ImageMagick is a robust collection of tools and libraries to read,
write, and manipulate an image in many image formats (over 71 major
formats) including popular formats like FlashPIX, GIF, JPEG, PDF, PNG,
Photo CD, SVG, TIFF, and WMF.  With ImageMagick you can create images
dynamically, making it suitable for Web applications.  You can also
resize, rotate, sharpen, color reduce, or add special effects to an
image and save your completed work in the same or differing image
format.  Image processing operations are available from the command
line, as well as through C, C++, and PERL-based programming
interfaces.

ImageMagick is copyrighted by ImageMagick Studio, a nonprofit
organization dedicated to making software imaging solutions freely
available.  ImageMagick is available for free, may be used to support
both open and proprietary applications, and may be redistributed
without fee.

ImageMagick 5.2.9 is available via ftp as

   ftp://ftp.simplesystems.org/pub/ImageMagick/ImageMagick-5.2.9.tar.gz

If ftp.simplesystems.org is overloaded (very likely), check the list of
mirrors at http://www.imagemagick.org/www/archives.html for other
mirrors.   You may want to use a mirror anyway, since many of the
mirrors are faster than simplesystems.org.

Note that the primary distribution site has changed in the past two
months.  If you are running a mirror site, please adjust your mirror
parameters.


Enhancements Over Previous Release:

  Previous releases defaulted to 8 bits per pixel component.  Version
  5.2.8 defaults to 16 bits per pixel component.  With this change
  there were a number of bug reports fixes which include

    o improvements to 16-bit PNG support

    o 8-bit ImageMagick can now read 16-bit PNM images

    o For image formats that support both 8 & 16 bit pixel components,
      the proper depth is selected.  Previously if the image was read as
      8-bit, it was written as 8-bit even if the depth was promoted to
      16-bit due to a transformation such as sharpen/draw.


Future Plans:

  o Magick++ HTML documentation installed under /usr/local/share/Magick++.

  o Improvements to SVG support.

  o Complete native WMF rendering support.

  o Work on gradients, image filters, and clipping paths.

  o Support for iptcutil and cgimagick utilities (code is written but
    documentation is still required).


ImageMagick is developed by the members of the ImageMagick Studio
team:

John Cristy           - Principal designer and author
Bob Friesenhahn       - Magick++, Unix modules, magic, configure, CVS,
                        tests, bug tracking, WMF.
William Radcliffe     - VisualMagick, FlashPix, TIFF, timers, watermarking,
                        Windows modules, fast polygon renderer.
Glenn Randers-Pehrson - PNG, MNG, and test script improvements
Leonard Rosenthol     - Mac support. Drawing enhancements.

We would like to give special thanks to several people who assist with
ImageMagick:

Alexander Zimmermann  - Builds the Linux distributions
Jaroslav Fojtik       - Has contributed several coder modules.

There are many other individual contributors, some of whom made
contributions to ImageMagick but shall remain nameless anyway.
