The ImageMagick Studio LLC development group announces the release of
ImageMagick 5.5.2. Version 5.5.2 is primarily a bug-fix release but does
provide a number of significant new features.

ImageMagick is a robust collection of tools and libraries to read,
write, and manipulate an image in many image formats (over 87 major
formats) including popular formats like FlashPIX, GIF, JPEG, PDF, PNG,
Photo CD, SVG, TIFF, and WMF. With ImageMagick images can be created
dynamically, making it suitable for Web applications. You can also
resize, rotate, sharpen, color reduce, or add special effects to an
image and save your completed work in the same or differing image
format. Image processing operations are available from the command line,
as well as through C, C++, PERL, Visual Basic, VBscript, and Jscript
based programming interfaces. Support for programming with Java and
Python is provided by 3rd parties.

ImageMagick is copyrighted by ImageMagick Studio, a nonprofit
organization dedicated to making software imaging solutions freely
available. ImageMagick is available for free, may be used to support
both open and proprietary applications, and may be redistributed without
fee.
