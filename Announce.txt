The ImageMagick Studio LLC development group announces the release of
ImageMagick 5.3.9.  Version 5.3.9 is a bug-fix release to resolve bugs
reported against 5.3.8.

ImageMagick is a robust collection of tools and libraries to read,
write, and manipulate an image in many image formats (over 71 major
formats) including popular formats like FlashPIX, GIF, JPEG, PDF, PNG,
Photo CD, SVG, TIFF, and WMF.  With ImageMagick you can create images
dynamically, making it suitable for Web applications.  You can also
resize, rotate, sharpen, color reduce, or add special effects to an
image and save your completed work in the same or differing image
format.  Image processing operations are available from the command
line, as well as through C, C++, and PERL-based programming
interfaces.

ImageMagick is copyrighted by ImageMagick Studio, a nonprofit
organization dedicated to making software imaging solutions freely
available.  ImageMagick is available for free, may be used to support
both open and proprietary applications, and may be redistributed
without fee.
