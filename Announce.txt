The ImageMagick Studio LLC development group announces the release of
ImageMagick 5.4.1. Version 5.4.1 is a feature release but also resolves
bugs reported against 5.4.0.

ImageMagick is a robust collection of tools and libraries to read,
write, and manipulate an image in many image formats (over 72 major
formats) including popular formats like FlashPIX, GIF, JPEG, PDF, PNG,
Photo CD, SVG, TIFF, and WMF.  With ImageMagick you can create images
dynamically, making it suitable for Web applications.  You can also
resize, rotate, sharpen, color reduce, or add special effects to an
image and save your completed work in the same or differing image
format.  Image processing operations are available from the command
line, as well as through C, C++, and PERL-based programming
interfaces.

ImageMagick is copyrighted by ImageMagick Studio, a nonprofit
organization dedicated to making software imaging solutions freely
available.  ImageMagick is available for free, may be used to support
both open and proprietary applications, and may be redistributed
without fee.

Significant changes from the 5.4.0 release (see release ChangeLog
for details):

  o General:

    - Many bugs fixed which were reported via the ImageMagick bug
      tracking system, or via the mailing lists.

    - WMF support is updated to use libwmf 0.2.2. Under Unix, WMF
      is rendered via ImageMagick drawing commands, whereas under
      Windows, WMF is rendered natively by Windows.

    - Support added for OTB, On-the-air bitmap format.

    - Most delegate library dependencies (e.g. libtiff) are moved to
      loadable modules, and the module inter-dependencies on delegate
      libraries have been minimized. This removes most link-time
      dependencies from programs which depend on libMagick.so.

    - Security enhancements added to protect against buffer overflow.

  o Utilities enhancements:

    - 'convert' now supports a '-channel' option, with enumerations
      'Cyan', 'Magenta', 'Yellow', and 'Black'.

    - The '-draw' command now accepts a command of the form
      'decorate color' to specify the text underbox color.

  o C API enhancements:

    - Desired image type (e.g. 'GrayscaleType') may be set via the
      ImageInfo 'type' member.

    - CloneImage() now uses an implicit referenced counted pixel cache.
      This eliminates the overhead caused by cloning an image which is
      never modified, or when the original image is not further modified.

    - New function 'AcquireImagePixels' supports obtaining a read-only
      view of image pixels.

    - Functions that can treat an image as read only now accept a
      'const Image *' parameter rather than 'Image *'.

    - Stroke dash pattern specifications are now of type 'double'
      rather than 'unsigned int' in order to support specification
      of non-integral patterns.

  o C++ API enhancements:

    - Added the Image::boundingBox method to return the smallest
      bounding box enclosing non-border pixels.

    - Added the Image::getConstIndexes method to return read-only pixel
      indexes.

    - Added the Image::getConstPixels method to return read-only pixels.

ImageMagick is developed by the members of the ImageMagick Studio
team:

John Cristy           - Principal designer and author.
Bob Friesenhahn       - Magick++, Unix modules, magic, configure, CVS,
                        tests, bug tracking, and WMF.
William Radcliffe     - VisualMagick, FlashPix, TIFF, timers, watermarking,
                        Windows modules, and fast polygon renderer.
Glenn Randers-Pehrson - PNG, MNG, and test script improvements
Leonard Rosenthol     - Mac support and drawing enhancements.

We would like to give special thanks to several people who assist with
ImageMagick:

Alexander Zimmermann  - Linux binary distributions.
Jaroslav Fojtik       - CUT, ART, and MATLAB coder modules.

There are many other individual contributors, some of whom made
significant contributions to ImageMagick but shall remain anonymous.
