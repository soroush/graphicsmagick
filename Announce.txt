The ImageMagick Studio LLC development group announces the release of
ImageMagick 5.4.1. Version 5.4.1 is a feature release but also resolves
bugs reported against 5.4.0.

ImageMagick is a robust collection of tools and libraries to read,
write, and manipulate an image in many image formats (over 72 major
formats) including popular formats like FlashPIX, GIF, JPEG, PDF, PNG,
Photo CD, SVG, TIFF, and WMF.  With ImageMagick you can create images
dynamically, making it suitable for Web applications.  You can also
resize, rotate, sharpen, color reduce, or add special effects to an
image and save your completed work in the same or differing image
format.  Image processing operations are available from the command
line, as well as through C, C++, and PERL-based programming
interfaces.

ImageMagick is copyrighted by ImageMagick Studio, a nonprofit
organization dedicated to making software imaging solutions freely
available.  ImageMagick is available for free, may be used to support
both open and proprietary applications, and may be redistributed
without fee.

Significant changes from the 5.4.0 release (see release ChangeLog
for details):

  o General:

    - Many bugs fixed which were reported via the ImageMagick bug
      tracking system, or via the mailing lists.

    - ImageMagick image registry format added (magick string "mpr").
      This format provides a means for in-memory images to be registered
      and passed to the drawing module (without use of temporary file)
      via the filename "mpr:id". Registration of images is managed via
      the SetMagickRegistry(), GetMagickRegistry(), and
      DeleteMagickRegistry() C APIs.

    - Support added for reading the GIMP's native XCF image format
      (thanks to Leonard Rosenthol).

    - WMF rendering is improved. Dashed lines are now supported. Text
      scaling and placement is significantly improved. Scaling and
      translation of coordinates to fit the image are done by the
      drawing module rather than within the WMF renderer.

    - Pattern definition, and filling with pattern, are now supported by
      the SVG renderer, and by ImageMagick's native drawing format
      (MVG). Support was also added for defining and filling with
      gradients (for simple gradients only).

    - The default background color is changed from 'white' to 'none'
      (transparent black).
      
  o Utilities enhancements/changes:

    - A display-like GUI for Windows is now available (thanks again to
      Leonard Rosenthol). Look for it in the source directory
      "contrib/win32/MFC/IMDisplay".

    - Abbreviated options are no longer supported.  This will impact
      any programs or scripts that used abbreviated options.

  o C API enhancements:

    - Added PingBlob() function to test a BLOB based on its header.

  o C++ API enhancements:

    - Eliminated memory leak in the draw() method.

    - DestroyMagick() is automatically invoked when the static
      destructors for the image module are invoked. This help eliminate
      apparent memory "leaks".

ImageMagick is developed by the members of the ImageMagick Studio
team:

John Cristy           - Principal designer and author.
Bob Friesenhahn       - Magick++, Unix modules, magic, configure, CVS,
                        tests, bug tracking, and WMF.
William Radcliffe     - VisualMagick, FlashPix, TIFF, timers, watermarking,
                        Windows modules, and fast polygon renderer.
Glenn Randers-Pehrson - PNG, MNG, and test script improvements
Leonard Rosenthol     - Mac support, XCF, and drawing enhancements.

We would like to give special thanks to several people who assist with
ImageMagick:

Alexander Zimmermann  - Linux binary distributions.
Jaroslav Fojtik       - CUT, ART, and MATLAB coder modules.

There are many other individual contributors, some of whom made
significant contributions to ImageMagick but shall remain anonymous.
