The ImageMagick Studio LLC development group announces the release of
ImageMagick 5.4.7.  Version 5.4.7 is a feature release but also resolves
bugs reported against 5.4.6.

ImageMagick is a robust collection of tools and libraries to read, write,
and manipulate an image in many image formats (over 72 major formats)
including popular formats like FlashPIX, GIF, JPEG, PDF, PNG, Photo CD,
SVG, TIFF, and WMF.  With ImageMagick you can create images dynamically,
making it suitable for Web applications.  You can also resize, rotate,
sharpen, color reduce, or add special effects to an image and save your
completed work in the same or differing image format.  Image processing
operations are available from the command line, as well as through C,
C++, and PERL-based programming interfaces.

ImageMagick is copyrighted by ImageMagick Studio, a nonprofit organization
dedicated to making software imaging solutions freely available.
ImageMagick is available for free, may be used to support both open and
proprietary applications, and may be redistributed without fee.

Significant changes from the 5.4.5 release (see release ChangeLog for
details):

  o General:
    * ImageMagick may now be built (static build only) using the
      free MinGW development package from http://www.mingw.org.
      Leonard's "clipboard" coder is included in the build.
  
    * Added new "clipboard" coder for reading/writing the system's
      clipboard.  Currently this is only implemented on Windows.
      For example:  'convert logo: clipboard:', 'convert clipboard: foo.png'
  
    * Support autotrace via delegates.mgk.
      For example:  'convert autotrace:file.png file.mvg'
  
    * Added progress monitor support to DrawImage().
  
    * Added progress monitor support to wmf.c.
  
    * Added EscapeText() to utility.c to support escaping text.
  
    * Text escaping for -draw and DrawAnnotation was not working properly.
      Now it does.  Backslash should act as a escape for the the active
      quote character (', ", or }) as well as backslash.  The backslash
      should be discarded if it was used as an escape character.  In order
      to reliably pass a backslash, two successive backslashes are required
      (e.g. "\\").
  
    * Modified Base64Encode() of utility.c so that it returns the number of
      characters encoded. This avoids having to invoke strlen() on possibly
      megabytes of data.
  
    * Fixed compilation error with Sun Workshop compiler (wmf.c).
  
    * Implement polypolygon support in WMF renderer.  Requires libwmf
      0.2.4 with draw_polypolygon IPA callback.
  
    * Added --enable-ccmalloc configure option.
  
    * DCM patch provided by Shane Blackett.
  
    * Lock mutex when destroying a SemaphoreInfo structure (patch provided
      by William Radcliffe).

    * Added mingw patches provided by Derry Bryson.

ImageMagick is developed by the members of the ImageMagick Studio
team:

John Cristy           - Principal designer and author.
Bob Friesenhahn       - Magick++, Unix modules, magic, configure, CVS,
                        tests, bug tracking, and WMF.
William Radcliffe     - VisualMagick, FlashPix, TIFF, timers,
                        watermarking, Windows modules, and fast polygon
                        renderer.
Glenn Randers-Pehrson - PNG, MNG, test scripts, documentation
                        enhancements.
Leonard Rosenthol     - Mac support, XCF, PSD, conjure, drawing
                        enhancements.

We would like to give special thanks to several people who assist with
ImageMagick:

Alexander Zimmermann  - Linux binary distributions.
Jaroslav Fojtik       - CUT, ART, and MATLAB coder modules.

There are many other individual contributors, some of whom made
significant contributions to ImageMagick but shall remain anonymous
anyway.
