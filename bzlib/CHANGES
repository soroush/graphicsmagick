0.9.0
~~~~~
First version.


0.9.0a
~~~~~~
Removed 'ranlib' from Makefile, since most modern Unix-es 
don't need it, or even know about it.


0.9.0b
~~~~~~
Fixed a problem with error reporting in bzip2.c.  This does not effect
the library in any way.  Problem is: versions 0.9.0 and 0.9.0a (of the
program proper) compress and decompress correctly, but give misleading
error messages (internal panics) when an I/O error occurs, instead of
reporting the problem correctly.  This shouldn't give any data loss
(as far as I can see), but is confusing.

Made the inline declarations disappear for non-GCC compilers.


0.9.0c
~~~~~~
Fixed some problems in the library pertaining to some boundary cases.
This makes the library behave more correctly in those situations.  The
fixes apply only to features (calls and parameters) not used by
bzip2.c, so the non-fixedness of them in previous versions has no
effect on reliability of bzip2.c.

In bzlib.c:
   * made zero-length BZ_FLUSH work correctly in BZ2_bzCompress().
   * fixed bzWrite/bzRead to ignore zero-length requests.
   * fixed bzread to correctly handle read requests after EOF.
   * wrong parameter order in call to BZ2_bzDecompressInit in
     bzBuffToBuffDecompress.  Fixed.

In compress.c:
   * changed setting of nGroups in sendMTFValues() so as to 
     do a bit better on small files.  This _does_ effect
     bzip2.c.


0.9.5a
~~~~~~
Major change: add a fallback sorting algorithm (blocksort.c)
to give reasonable behaviour even for very repetitive inputs.
Nuked --repetitive-best and --repetitive-fast since they are
no longer useful.

Minor changes: mostly a whole bunch of small changes/
bugfixes in the driver (bzip2.c).  Changes pertaining to the
user interface are:

   allow decompression of symlink'd files to stdout
   decompress/test files even without .bz2 extension
   give more accurate error messages for I/O errors
   when compressing/decompressing to stdout, don't catch control-C
   read flags from BZIP2 and BZIP environment variables
   decline to break hard links to a file unless forced with -f
   allow -c flag even with no filenames
   preserve file ownerships as far as possible
   make -s -1 give the expected block size (100k)
   add a flag -q --quiet to suppress nonessential warnings
   stop decoding flags after --, so files beginning in - can be handled
   resolved inconsistent naming: bzcat or bz2cat ?
   bzip2 --help now returns 0

Programming-level changes are:

   fixed syntax error in GET_LL4 for Borland C++ 5.02
   let bzBuffToBuffDecompress return BZ_DATA_ERROR{_MAGIC}
   fix overshoot of mode-string end in bzopen_or_bzdopen
   wrapped bzlib.h in #ifdef __cplusplus ... extern "C" { ... }
   close file handles under all error conditions
   added minor mods so it compiles with DJGPP out of the box
   fixed Makefile so it doesn't give problems with BSD make
   fix uninitialised memory reads in dlltest.c

0.9.5b
~~~~~~
Open stdin/stdout in binary mode for DJGPP.

0.9.5c
~~~~~~
Changed BZ_N_OVERSHOOT to be ... + 2 instead of ... + 1.  The + 1
version could cause the sorted order to be wrong in some extremely
obscure cases.  Also changed setting of quadrant in blocksort.c.

0.9.5d
~~~~~~
The only functional change is to make bzlibVersion() in the library
return the correct string.  This has no effect whatsoever on the
functioning of the bzip2 program or library.  Added a couple of casts
so the library compiles without warnings at level 3 in MS Visual
Studio 6.0.  Included a Y2K statement in the file Y2K_INFO.  All other
changes are minor documentation changes.
